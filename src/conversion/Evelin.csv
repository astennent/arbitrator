Police shot a man threatening patrons of a historic Long Beach gaming venue with a knife Monday night — while he was sitting.

The man who was shot, identified by the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office only as a 39-year-old Carson resident, was waving the knife at Looff’s Lite-A-Line Casino Game of Skill at 2500 Long Beach Blvd. near the Wrigley neighborhood shortly after 10 p.m.

“We can confirm that he was in a seated position at the time of the shooting,” said Cmdr. Robert Luman, who heads the Long Beach Police Department’s Gang and Violent Crimes Division. “We’re investigating the posture and the perceived threat of him being in possession of a knife.”

The man’s seated position does not mean he wasn’t a threat, Luman said.

Officers gave the man verbal commands to drop the knife, but he did not comply, according to information provided by the department. Police then used less-lethal weapons, including a baton and Taser before firing shots.

Authorities are investigating why the less-lethal means failed to subdue the man, and a clearer picture should emerge once the coroner’s office conducts the autopsy and completes its full report, Luman said.

The knife was recovered at the scene.

Before officers arrived at Looff’s Lite-A-Line Casino Game, police received reports that the man was waving the knife and that some customers had left in fear for their lives, said Sgt. Brad Johnson of the Long Beach Police Department. Police said the man had also been thrown out of the business on prior occasions for being disruptive, police said.

Officers started life-saving measures after firing the shots, and Long Beach firefighters continued the effort until pronouncing the man dead at the scene, Johnson said.

No other injuries were reported.

Limited portions of the incident were captured on video, which will be reviewed by the Police Department’s Homicide detectives and the L.A. County District Attorney’s Office, according to the department.

The man’s name will be released when next-of-kin are notified.

Northbound Long Beach Boulevard was closed from Burnett to Willow streets for several hours while an investigation was underway.

Anyone who may have witnessed this incident, or has information is encouraged to call the Long Beach Police Department’s Homicide Detail at 562-570-7244.

A Long Beach police officer shot and killed a knife-wielding man at an arcade business Monday night after police were unable to subdue him using less lethal devices, authorities said.

Police arrived just before 10 p.m. at Looffs Lite-A-Line in the 2500 block of Long Beach Boulevard following reports of a man waving a knife inside, Long Beach police Sgt. Brad Johnson said. Several customers feared for their safety and left the business.

Officers asked the man to drop the knife, but he ignored them, Johnson said.

Two officers tried to subdue the man with an electronic control device and a baton, Johnson said, but the efforts were ineffective.

One of the two officers fired shots and struck the man, who was pronounced dead when Long Beach firefighters arrived, Johnson said.

The family of a mentally disabled man shot and killed by Long Beach police last year claims officers used excessive force during the deadly clash in an arcade, according to a legal claim filed Thursday.

Mharloun Saycon, 39, was seated in a chair when Long Beach police officers used an electric stun weapon and hit him with batons before ultimately shooting him inside Looff's Lite-A-Line on Dec. 14, according to a notice of claim filed by Saycon's relatives. A legal claim is usually a precursor to a lawsuit.

The family also called on the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to prosecute the officers involved in Saycon's death, according to the document. Officers knew that Saycon suffered from a mental disability, the document said.

See the most-read stories this hour >>
""There was absolutely no need for this use of lethal force,"" the notice of claim read. ""Neither the officer nor anyone else was in danger.""

The day after the shooting, Long Beach police said in a statement that two officers were responding to reports of a knife-wielding man at the arcade and that several customers had left the store in fear for their safety.

Saycon ignored several orders to drop the knife, according to police, and attempts to subdue him with a Taser and batons failed. One of the officers opened fire, and Saycon was pronounced dead at the scene.

The family, however, contends in the legal claim that there was no panic inside the arcade, and said the staff was familiar with Saycon. They also claimed the officers were told Saycon suffered from a mental disability but failed to de-escalate the situation. 

""Mharloun was a good son, a gentle person,"" his mother, Anna Luz Saycon, said in a statement. ""He lived at home, and he took care of me. He'd call me at work and say 'Mom, you rest, I'll cook dinner.' I love him so much. I can't believe he's gone.""

Asked whether Saycon disobeyed police orders on the day of the shooting, an attorney representing the family said Saycon was seated and confused when police arrived.

The attorney, Dan Stormer, called Saycon's death a ""police-created killing."" Several witnesses who called 911 from the arcade told police that Saycon was not a threat, according to Stormer, who said police have refused to release 911 recordings related to the case.

Saycon emigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines in 1985. He was an athlete and honor student at Santa Monica High School and attended Santa Monica College before he was diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia in his early 20s, his family said during a Thursday news conference outside the Long Beach Police Department's headquarters.

According to the notice of claim, the incident began when an arcade employee noticed Saycon was scratching a three-inch knife against a table. The employee asked Saycon to put the blade away, and he complied, according to the claim.

Saycon remained in the building, and another employee eventually called police and asked for help escorting the 39-year-old from the premises.

In the claim, the family alleges that officers used a Taser against Saycon as soon as they arrived, without giving him any verbal commands. The family claims that an officer then struck Saycon with a baton, even though he wasn't resisting.

Seconds later, the family said, an officer ""immediately"" opened fire on Saycon. He was struck eight times in the arm, chest and abdomen, according to the claim.

""During this whole incident, Mharloun never waved the knife around, did not point it at anyone, and never threatened anyone with it,"" the notice of claim said.

Long Beach police fatally shoot man
Looff's Lite-A-Line in the 2500 block of Long Beach Boulevard was closed after police shot and killed a man who was waving a knife inside the business in December 2015.
The claim did not specify whether Saycon was holding the knife when police arrived.

A Long Beach police spokesman said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. The officer involved in Saycon's death has not been identified, and the spokesman declined to release the name without the filing of a public records request. 

It was not clear whether the officer who shot Saycon has returned to active duty.

The agency drew criticism and protests last year following two other fatal police shootings.

In April 2015, a police officer responding to a report about vandalism shot and killed 19-year-old Hector Morejon. Police said the officer believed Morejon was pointing a gun at him, but no weapons were recovered at the scene.

Several weeks later, an officer shot and killed Feras Morad, a Moorpark College student who had competed nationally in high school speech and debate contests. Morad, 20, had an adverse reaction after taking hallucinogenic mushrooms, according to a cousin, and either fell or leapt through a plate-glass window.


An officer found Morad covered in blood and offered to help him, but Morad advanced and fought with the officer, police said. The officer tried to subdue Morad, who was not armed, by using a stun gun and striking him with a flashlight, before firing the fatal shot, the department said at the time.

Morad's family filed a wrongful death suit against the city late last year, days after Saycon was killed. 

Prosecutors are reviewing the shooting deaths of both Morad and Morejon. A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office said the agency has not received information about Saycon's death.

The officers involved in Morad and Morejon's shootings have both returned to active duty, according to a Long Beach police spokesman.

THONOTOSASSA — A concerned caller brought two Hills­borough County sheriff's deputies Tuesday to a gated estate in a sprawling neighborhood of mansions near Lake Thonotosassa.

""When deputies arrived,"" said Col. Donna Lusczynski, ""they were confronted by a man with a gun.""

He ignored commands to drop the weapon, Lusczynski said, and instead started to raise the firearm.

The veteran deputies opened fire, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, leaving the gunman fatally wounded outside — and leading to the discovery of another body inside the home at 11008 Smoken Gun Lane.

The man found inside the home appeared to be the victim of a homicide, but deputies did not disclose how he was killed.

Hours after Tuesday's confrontation, sheriff's officials had disclosed few details about the fatal shooting outside the home or the dead man found inside it.

The Sheriff's Office also didn't identify either person — gunman or homicide victim.

Lusczynski said neither deputy involved in the shooting was injured.

They were identified as Deputy Mark Barnwell, 52, who has been on the force for 29 years, and Deputy Izzy Roquemore, 45, who has 15 years on the job. Neither has been involved in a shooting before, Lusczynski said.

After the incident, they were both placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings.

The chain of events started about 3:17 p.m., when Barnwell and Roquemore were dispatched to Smoken Gun Lane to investigate a report of a disturbance in the neighborhood. Officials did not say what the disturbance was.

The 5,000-square-foot home sits on 3.4 acres surrounded by a fence. An iron gate blocks the driveway, which empties onto Fort King Highway.

The home is located in the Winners Circle subdivision near U.S. 301, between John B. Sargeant Sr. Park and Lake Thonotosassa. The neighborhood is home to some well-known community figures such as former gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink and recreational vehicle entrepreneur Don Wallace.

The deputies said when they arrived at the home, an armed man approached Barnwell and Roquemore. Both deputies ordered him to lower the gun several times. When he raised his gun instead, they fired, Lusczynski said.

Public records show Scott Tomlinson owns the property where the home is located. He also owns a nearby company, Tomlinson Brothers Plastering Inc., with his brother, Todd Tomlinson, according to records.

Attempts to reach members of the Tomlinson family Tuesday evening were unsuccessful.

THONOTOSASSA, Fla. –  Authorities say deputies shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at them as they responded to a domestic disturbance call at a home near Tampa.

In a news release, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said 51-year-old Todd Tomlinson was shot multiple times after refusing to drop his weapon Tuesday night. He was declared dead at the scene.

Dallas police say a wanted sex offender was shot and killed by Dallas police Tuesday afternoon after he pulled out a gun and pointed at officers. (Published Tuesday, July 7, 2015)
A wanted sex offender was shot and killed by Dallas police Tuesday afternoon after he pulled out a gun and pointed it at officers, police say.

Dallas police confirmed the shooting Tuesday afternoon and said officers with the Sex Offender Apprehension Program and METRO units were in the area following up on Crime Stoppers tip about the man, identified as 59-year-old Joe Cody, wanted for a parole violation on a sex-related crime.
Blankenbaker said several officers, both in uniform and others in plain clothes, were following up on the Crime Stoppers tip about the Cody's location.
Police said Cody was spotted just before 1:30 p.m. and uniformed officers moved in to contact him as he walked along the 1200 block of North Bishop Avenue.
Officers approached Cody as he neared the intersection of Wickford Street and Bishop Avenue, Blankenbaker said, and he quickly pulled out a weapon and pointed it at police.

The officers ordered Cody to drop the weapon, Blankenbaker said, but he did not comply. Witnesses told NBC 5 that Cody then began shooting before the officers returned fire.
Blankenbaker said four officers, three with the SOAP unit and another with the METRO unit, are believed to have fired on Cody, killing him. None of the officers were injured.
At the same intersection, a red Volkswagen sedan was seen stopped at the stop sign with both the driver's-side front door and back passenger-side door ajar. Blankenbaker said that vehicle was used by the department's plain-clothes officers who were investigating the Crime Stoppers tip.
The car appears to have several bullet holes in it, but Blankenbaker could not say if those shots came from Cody or from police officers.
Blankenbaker could also not confirm if Cody fired any shots before the police fired upon him.
Police said witnesses to the shooting supported the story provided by officers at the scene.
Dallas police cordoned off a large area of Bishop Avenue with crime scene tape and closed the roadway between Colorado Boulevard and Neches Street immediately south of Methodist Dallas Medical Center while the shooting was investigated by the department's Special Investigations Unit.

Dallas police said the department's sex offender apprehension unit was in the area near Methodist Dallas Medical Center trying to track down 59-year-old Joe Cody after receiving an anonymous tip.

Detectives were told Cody was a violent sex offender who had violated parole and was possibly armed and dangerous.

After detectives spotted the suspect, uniformed officers were called in to handle the arrest.

Investigators said Cody ignored all orders and pulled out a gun. That's when police said four of the officers fired shots, killing him. All four officers have served less than a year on the force, according to information released Thursday by Dallas Police.

Each of the officers was placed on administrative leave.

""The officers gave the suspect verbal commands to drop the gun,"" said Dallas police Assistant Chief Randy Blankenbaker. ""The suspect did not comply, forcing the officers to discharge their weapons.""

It was a chaotic scene that residents never expected to see in their quiet neighborhood.

""Very uncomfortable,"" said Andres Sandoval. ""This is the first time I've seen something like this. I didn't hear any shots... not even on the 4th of July.""

Police said it is still unclear whether Cody opened fire before officers. No police personnel were injured, although gunfire shattered a window on one DPD vehicle.

A blue tarp was placed over Cody's body in front of a townhome as police investigated.

On Tuesday night an officer was involved in a shooting that left one man dead.

Police say the suspect, 63-year old Joseph Tassinari, died at the scene and the officer that fired at him is not injured.

At first officers responded to what they thought was an armed robbery at a bank, but it turns out it wasn't.

The shooting happened near 67th and Peoria avenues just before 9 p.m. on Tuesday.

Police say Tassinari had a gun and he allegedly made a threat with that gun which caused a woman at a nearby bank to fear for her life.

According to Glendale police, he fled the scene and they found him at his home where they ended up shooting him.

""I heard the gun shots and the first thing that I did was lock all of my doors,"" said witness Jamie Deters, who lives nearby.

After she heard gunshots, she heard sirens.

""Looked out the window, a lot of cop cars descended on the neighborhood,"" she said.

Police then showed up at Tassinari's house.

They were looking for a suspect after a woman reported seeing a man with a gun in the Wells Fargo bank parking lot off of 67th Avenue and Bell Road. The suspect was gone by the time police arrived, but the woman wrote down his license plate.

""There were a lot of officers in my yard with large rifles,"" Deters said.

Officers found Tassinari still in his vehicle.

Police say they used a taser on him, but it had little effect.

According to Glendale police, an officer fired his gun when he perceived a deadly threat. Police say Tassinari allegedly reached for his waistband.

He died at the scene and police say he was armed.

Deters wants to know more about what led up to the officer pulling the trigger.

""An officer, if they feel threatened they have to protect themselves,"" she said. "" They have to go home safe to their family.""

Neighbors want to know why he would have shown his gun to a lady at the bank. Police say they don't know if the suspect knew the victim in any way.

People who live nearby say Tassinari is a Vietnam veteran and was very involved in helping out veterans and those in need across the Valley.

Posted: Thursday, March 26, 2015 12:00 pm
Staff report
Glendale police have released the name of the officer who shot and killed a suspect during an incident Tuesday night.
The involved Glendale Police officer, Jacob Martinson, was placed on paid administrative leave, as is standard in any officer-involved shooting. He is an 11-year veteran police officer and field training officer assigned to the Foothills Patrol Division.
Martinson shot and killed and armed man who refused his commands and appeared to be reaching for the weapon during an incident near 67th and Bell Road, police said.
In a prepared statement, the department also said Joseph Tassinari, 63, had taken out the handgun and threatened a woman at a drive-through ATM around 9 p.m., prior to the shooting.
Police spokeswoman, officer Tracey Breeden, said the woman and a relative were at the Wells Fargo ATM in the 6700 block of West Bell Road when a man pulled in directly behind the woman’s vehicle in a white pickup truck and began yelling profanities at her and honking his horn.
“She pulled forward and began to exit her vehicle, when the subject displayed a handgun, pointed it at her and verbally threatened her. She got back in her vehicle and immediately called police. The subject fled the scene in his truck. The female and (the) relative were able to get the license-plate number on the truck and provided police with a description of the subject and the vehicle,” Breeden stated.
The plate information referred police to a residence in the 6600 block of West Christy Drive, where an officer in the area responded and saw the pickup truck in the driveway and a man matching Tassinari’s description near the truck.
While requesting additional assistance, the officer contacted and addressed the subject near his pickup truck giving him commands. The subject was noncompliant and told the officer he had a gun. The officer radioed for help and continued to give commands as he deployed his Taser, which was ineffective on the subject. The subject continued to be noncompliant and began to reach for his waistband. Martinson perceived a deadly threat and, fearing for his life, fired his weapon, striking the suspect, Breeden stated.
Tassinari was declared dead at the scene by Glendale Fire Dept. personnel.
No one else was hurt.
Police did not say what prompted Tassinari’s initial confrontation with the woman.

LEXINGTON COUNTY, SC (WIS/AP) -
The Lexington County Coroner has identified the man shot and killed by Lexington County deputies Monday. 

Corner Margaret Fisher says Timothy Milliken, 56, died at the scene from several gunshot wounds to his upper body. 

Lexington County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Adam Myrick said two deputies were called to the 100 block of East Selwood Lane around 4:45 p.m. When they arrived to the home, they found a man attacking a family member with a knife, Myrick said.

Mobile users, tap here to see photos from the scene.

“Fearing for the life of the family member, both officers discharged their service weapon, fatally striking the subject,” Myrick said in a statement.

Myrick said both deputies, whose names are not being released, have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the results of the shooting investigation by the State Law Enforcement Division.

The condition of the family member who was stabbed was not immediately available. 

""This is, really, not only tragic, but it's just so out of the ordinary,"" neighbor Ralph Rucco said. ""Obviously, this is a very quiet community and a very peaceful area. Certainly, there's been zero altercations that we know of since we've lived here, and we've been here are a number of years, so it's startling and it shocking, You know, to have this happen right next door.""

This is the 29th officer-involved shooting this year, according to the State Law Enforcement Division.

The Associated Press reports that South Carolina is on pace for 51 officer-involved shootings in 2015, eclipsing the previous 15-year high of 45 officer shootings in 2012. Shootings involving police officers in South Carolina have been on the rise since 27 were reported in 2009, with more than 40 reported in each of the past three years.

EDINBURG — As police surrounded Richard LaPort's home in the rural darkness, he moved inside and out firing gunshots, then stepped outside and ""leveled the long gun"" toward the law enforcement officers, Saratoga County Sheriff Michael Zurlo said.
Police said that's when they had to use deadly force, shooting and killing the 51-year-old on Monday night.
At a news conference Tuesday, Zurlo described the harrowing incident at 96 Fox Hill Road that authorities are calling ""suicide by police.""
LaPort had called county dispatchers at 10 p.m. saying he wanted to harm himself, Zurlo said.
Ten deputies and three state troopers surrounded the mobile home, located east of Great Sacandaga Lake. The sheriff said deputies used a loudspeaker in a squad car to urge LaPort to put down the shotgun and surrender, and negotiations continued for 40 minutes.
Zurlo said LaPort fired the gun at least four times as he strode around the home, and at 11:41 p.m. he came out and pointed his weapon toward police positioned in front of the house. From about 30 years away, two deputies and a trooper fired at LaPort, striking him at least once in the torso, Zurlo said.
More Information

The preliminary investigation shows police made every attempt to reach a peaceful resolution, only reacting with deadly force when LaPort made an offensive move with his weapon — ""placing the members in fear for their personal safety and the safety of their fellow officers,"" Zurlo said.
LaPort was declared dead at the scene by EMS members. The Edinburg and the Community ambulance squads were deployed. No one else was inside the home.
Zurlo declined to name the three officers involved in the shooting. He said the deputies had 10 to 15 years' experience. State Police Capt. Scott Coburn said the trooper had less than five years' experience.
Dr. Michael Sikirica's autopsy on LaPort at Albany Medical Center Hospital ruled he died as the result of a single gunshot wound to the chest as the result of suicide by police, according to a news release from the sheriff issued on Tuesday evening.
In October 2013, LaPort's father, who was an Edinburg town highway employee, was accidentally run over by a town pickup truck driven by Highway Superintendent Wayne Seelow. Seelow backed over the elder LaPort, 69, while working on a paving job on King Road, according to troopers at the time.
A neighbor who lived near the home on Fox Hill Road said the son grew up in Edinburg but traveled around the United States and Mexico for most of his adult life. She said Richard LaPort moved back to the area around the time his father was killed. He was quiet and talked of leaving the area, but he remained, said the neighbor, who asked not to be named.
Last month, Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave Attorney General Eric Schneiderman the power to investigate killings by police. However, on Tuesday Saratoga County District Attorney Karen Heggen said Schneiderman's authority was limited to cases involving unarmed people.
Heggen said it was too early to determine what action, if any, her office would take. Both the State Police and sheriff's office are continuing their investigation.",Yes,No,,No,,"http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/33/51/8239734/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg ,

920x920There will be no charges brought in the police shooting of an armed man outside his rural Saratoga County home because the man threatened authorities multiple times, the Saratoga County district attorney said Tuesday.

Richard LaPort, 51, fired a shotgun twice into the air and later pointed it at police officers that he called to his home on Fox Hill Road in Edinburg during the night of June 29, District Attorney Karen Heggen said. LaPort had told a 911 dispatcher that he was going to shoot himself, and ignored numerous pleas from police to drop his weapon, Heggen said, in closing her review of the case.

LaPort called 911 on the night of his death to say he wanted to tell the district attorney something, Heggen said. “He never explained what this information was,” she said. When police arrived at his home, they tried to negotiate with him, but he paced in and out of his home in an agitated state while holding a shotgun, Heggen said.

At the end of a 45-minute exchange, LaPort pointed his shotgun at officers, “presenting an imminent threat,” Heggen said. Two members of the sheriff’s department and a State Trooper fired at him, Heggen said. LaPort was struck once just before midnight and died at the scene. At the time of the shooting, Sheriff Michael Zurlo described the case as an example of “suicide by police.” Toxicology tests showed alcohol and prescription medication in LaPort’s blood, Heggen said.

I tried to contact LaPort’s daughter for a reaction to Heggen’s decision to close the case.

Memphis police shot and killed a man early Wednesday morning after officers said the man — who police said was intoxicated and may have had a mental illness — fired shots at them.

Police later identified the man as James Greenwell, 31. The shooting happened just before 7:30 a.m. at Greenwell’s parents' home in the 700 block of Auburndale in the Vollintine-Evergreen neighborhood near North Memphis.

Police responded after receiving a call that Greenwell’s father was involved in a situation with his son, who police labeled a “mental consumer.” That’s standard police jargon for someone with a mental illness.

“The son was intoxicated and he was armed with a gun. Officers attempted to get the suspect to surrender. However, the suspect fired shots at the officers and the officers returned fire, fatally wounding the suspect,” police spokeswoman Alyssa Macon-Moore said.

Macon-Moore said Greenwell had fired a shot inside the home and was sitting on the porch armed with a handgun when police arrived. He then opened fire on officers, police said.

Greenwell’s parents were not injured, although his mother was in shock and was treated in an ambulance on the scene.

Neighbor Travis White said he left work at Budweiser in West Memphis after his girlfriend called to tell him about the standoff on their street.

“I just want to get to my house and hug my girlfriend and son,” said White. “My girlfriend called me to come home and I left immediately because she was very upset and shaken.”

Greg Young, who lives on nearby Evergreen, said he heard several shots.

“I heard five to six shots,” said Young. “I tried to investigate but was run off by police.”

Police had all the streets around Auburndale cordoned off with police tape during the incident, and for several hours afterward.

MPD’s TACT unit was on the scene in force but left around 8:30 a.m. Officers with the department’s Crisis Intervention Team who respond to critical calls including those involving people with mental illnesses were also on the scene. Although Police Director Toney Armstrong was on the scene, he didn’t speak to the media.

Police have not identified the officers involved in the shooting, saying they are being debriefed and the shooting remains under investigation.

This is the second fatal officer-involved shooting this year. Last month, Anthony Bess, 48, was shot and killed by police when officers said he pointed a gun at them as they served a warrant on him at his Whitehaven home. One of the officers was also shot in the arm by another officer during that incident.",Yes,No,,No,,"http://media.jrn.com/images/0312_malo_standoff1_1426088097159_14849078_ver1.0_640_480.jpg ,

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A former police captain gives us a closer look at the tough call officers had to make Wednesday at a deadly standoff in Midtown.

The three officers said they had no choice but to use deadly force when 31-year-old James Greenwell fired at them.

""It's all done in an instant,"" said hostage negotiation expert C.T. Freeman.

That instant has rippling effects.

Police said Greenwell, who suffered from a mental illness, showed up to his parents house on Auburndale armed with a gun, and started fighting with them.

Investigators said Greenwell then fired at police, and three officers fired back and killed him.

""There are some situations that are not negotiable. They just aren't. Whenever someone starts shooting that limits your options,"" said Freeman.

Freeman is a former police captain, a criminology professor at the University of Memphis, and trains Memphis Police officers how to handle intense situations with mentally ill people.

""There's a way you have to do that. You can't be forceful,"" said Freeman.

He said MPD's training, called the Memphis Model, sets the bar nationwide. In fact, 2,700 agencies copied it.

Essentially, doctors and experts teach the officers how to talk with mentally ill people.

""The officers have to understand what options they have. What resources they have in the mental health community that's going to help them,"" said Freeman.

WREG is told officers with the training were at Wednesday's standoff, and tried to calm Greenwell down. Nothing worked.

Police said he was also drunk.

""Seconds later, I hear three more gunshots. Boom. Boom. Boom,"" said neighbor John Bagwell.

Greenwell's mother was carried away in a stretcher.

A man who was at the home Wednesday evening was too upset to talk to us too.

""It is going to be looked at by people for weeks, months and years,"" said Freeman. ""It's going to have a big impact on the community.""

The officers were relived of duty until the department justifies what they did.

MPD said if officers need it, they will provide counseling.

"Chance Thompson
",143,"Police were responding to reports that Thompson was acting strangely. He is believed to have been on methamphetamine. Police used a Taser on Thompson after he began attacking one of the deputies, and went into cardiac arrest soon after.",Ruled justified,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/05/police-tasers-deaths-the-counted,The Counted Bolts from the blue,"Death by Taser: a difficult determination
Chance Thompson was striding and shadowboxing when two Yuba County deputies encountered him on top of a wall outside a deserted manufacturing plant in rural California. It was the early hours of 15 February, and both deputies, Jaime Knacke and Daniel Trumm, observed that Thompson appeared to be high on drugs.

They instructed him to get down, but when Thompson seemed oblivious to their requests, Trumm grabbed him by the trousers and pulled him off the ledge. A passerby captured part of the altercation on video, showing the two grappling briefly before Knacke deployed her Taser. Thompson fell to the ground instantly.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest
The video shows that Trumm is seemingly able to gain control of the 35-year-old, who was flat on his face after the Taser is fired. But the eyewitnesses stopped recording shortly after. According to the deputies’ account, Thompson subsequently “bucked” them both off and continued resisting.

The data from Knacke’s Taser, revealed in documents released to the Guardian by the county prosecutor, shows Thompson was subsequently shocked another five times – each for a full five-second cycle – before he was placed in handcuffs. He was then shocked once more, meaning a total of seven cycles – or 35 seconds.

It was at this point, according to their report, when the deputies noticed Thompson was having difficulty breathing. He had “white foam around his mouth and nose, his face was red, and his pupils were fully dilated with no iris color visible,” they observed. Shortly after that, he lapsed out of consciousness and his heart stopped beating. Despite later being revived, Thompson was pronounced brain-dead in hospital. The life-support machine was switched off two days later.

“What Chance was doing was non-violent. Nobody was in danger from him – he was out in the middle of the country,” Thompson’s stepfather, Ray Guthrie, said in a telephone interview. “You Taser him once, and he’s on his back, with the officer’s knees in him. He’s not resisting arrest anymore. But they just continued.”

The Yuba County sheriff’s department has one of the more restrictive policies obtained by the Guardian, advising that deputies should acknowledge signs of intoxication before use, refrain from deploying Tasers on people in restraints, and avoid shocks in the chest. But both internal and criminal investigations found no wrongdoing.

Thompson’s autopsy, conducted two days after the altercation and obtained under a records request, classed the cause of his death as a lack of oxygen to the brain following cardiac arrest after a “violent struggle”. While the pathologist noted the “attempted restraint with electronic control device” as a significant condition, the manner of death was left “undetermined”. The Taser darts were noted in Thompson’s lower back and left shoulder.

For Yuba County district attorney Patrick McGrath, this medical ruling appeared to be enough to absolve the officers of criminal responsibility. “I’m not even sure [the Taser] contributed,” McGrath told the local newspaper. Noting the high levels of methamphetamine found in Thompson’s blood (the 35-year-old had a long history of substance abuse), McGrath continued: “His methamphetamine level ... was off the charts.”

Thompson’s family considers that line of argument part of a cover-up. “It was quite obviously excessive use of force,” said Guthrie. “He wouldn’t have died if they hadn’t have tased him several times. Obviously.”",Yes,Yes,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51a3d0743a20af56f418f9a22deed372b1fdb352/50_0_268_260/master/268.jpg?w=140&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=97bd24227d9f81b5db6edcb42e4e968d,No,,https://youtu.be/SAvQRfh58G0,http://www.appeal-democrat.com/news/yuba-county-deputies-cleared-in-fatal-taser-incident/article_bdcfc664-46e7-11e5-ad03-83a5c314a92e.html,"Yuba County deputies cleared in fatal Taser incident

 DA's Report 
Posted: Wednesday, August 19, 2015 8:01 pm
By Monica Vaughan/ mvaughan@appealdemocrat.com
Criminal charges will not be filed against two Yuba County deputies who used force and a Taser in an attempt to restrain a man who was on methamphetamine.
The man died five days after the incident, which is considered an ""in-custody death.""
The decision is outlined by Yuba County District Attorney Patrick McGrath in a report released Wednesday that examines whether any criminal conduct occurred on the part of either deputy Jaime Knacke or Daniel Trumm in the death of Chance Dale Thompson.
Thompson, 35, struggled with deputies after he was seen kicking the air and talking to himself while trespassing at Western Aggregates LLC off of Hammonton-Smartsville Road at 2 a.m. Feb. 15.
During the struggle, Knacke used a Taser seven times in attempts to restrain Thompson, who was later found to have alcohol and high levels of methamphetamine in his system, the report says.
""There is substantial evidence that the officers' actions in these rapidly changing circumstances met the standard of a reasonably prudent law enforcement officer, and the use of a Taser was an objectively reasonable use of force under the law,"" McGrath said in the report.
Witnesses, including a group of uninvolved adults who captured a video of the event and a security guard at the business, all observed the events that led to the struggle and use of the Taser. Their stories were consistent with the deputies'.
Thompson died after he was removed from life support in the early morning hours of Feb. 20. The cause of death was determined to be hypoxic encephalopathy due to cardiopulmonary arrest after a violent struggle.
Whether the use of the Taser caused Thompson's death is undetermined, according to both McGrath and Undersheriff Jerry Read.
""I'm not even sure it contributed,"" McGrath said. ""His methamphetamine level ...was off the charts.""
Use of force
The Taser was first deployed within four minutes of the deputies' arrival.
""Thompson was seen pacing on top of the rock wall with balled fists in what was described as a 'fighting stance,'"" the report said.
Deputies attempted to ask Thompson to get off the wall, but he did not react to the deputies' voices. Knacke unholstered her Taser and directed it toward Thompson and threatened to use the weapon, but his behavior did not change.
Trumm said he reached up to grab the back pocket of Thompson's pants. Thompson either fell or was pulled down and immediately attempted to place Trumm in a headlock. Knacke deployed her Taser, and Thompson fell to the ground.
""Both Knacke and Trumm attempted to hold Thompson down but were 'bucked' off,"" the report says. ""Knacke cycled the Taser again with little effect.""
Sgt. Josh Jellsey, who was on his way to the scene, was informed a Taser was used and called for medical aid.
After Thompson was handcuffed, he continued to kick his legs, and deputies were unable to control him.
""Knacke cycled the Taser again, and Trumm observed Thompson's body tense during the charge and then resume bucking and kicking.""
Trumm moved Thompson into a ""figure four"" control hold, and ""Thompson's breathing became labored and his face took on a bluish color.""
Thompson was rolled on his right side, and his breathing was clear, but he again began bucking. Thompson was again placed into a control hold.
When Jellsey arrived, he observed Thompson ""appeared to have difficulty breathing, there was white foam around his mouth and nose, his face was red, and his pupils were fully dilated with no iris color visible.""
Thompson alternated ""between continuing to struggle and becoming nonresponsive with shallow breathing and a pulse"" until he became fully nonresponsive with no breathing or detected pulse.
Jellsey and Trumm initiated CPR until fire and medical personnel arrived and took over. After five minutes, a pulse was restored, and he was placed into an ambulance and transported to Rideout Memorial Hospital. A pulse was lost in the ambulance, and he was stabilized after arrival at the emergency department.
Use of methamphetamine
Thompson was living in a ""sober home"" at the time of the incident and had completed a 90-day residential treatment program in Auburn the same month, after he had been released from state prison.
The program director last saw Thompson on Feb. 13 and said Thompson had been making great progress. He had completed a resume, obtained a car and auto insurance and had a job interview, the report says.
""His death was tragic, not only for him, his family and the deputies involved, but because he was doing well in recovery,"" McGrath said. ""This is an example to folks how difficult it can be for people who have long-time methamphetamine use.""
Thompson had previously told a probation officer he began using methamphetamine at 14 or 15 and used about $20 worth of the drug daily, primarily by intravenous injection.
Toxicology results of blood samples taken 17 hours after his interaction with deputies showed amphetamine levels detected at 60 mg/ml and methamphetamine detected at 390 mg/ml. Those levels are ""extremely elevated and consistent with amounts associated with circulatory collapse,"" McGrath said.
Blood levels of 200-600 ng/ml have been reported in methamphetamine abusers who exhibited violent and irrational behavior, according to the toxicology report. ""High doses of methamphetamine can also elicit restlessness, confusion, hallucinations, circulatory collapse and convulsions.""",Yes,No,,No,,http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/appeal-democrat.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/5a/35a8a7a0-46e8-11e5-9385-4fdf8b268cee/55d5444fd2422.preview.jpg?resize=100%2C129,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2:00 AM,Indoors,Other.

Police have identified Alexander Tirado Rivera as the man who was fatally shot Saturday after he took a hostage and attempted to rob a cash loan center.

The shooting occurred in front of an Easy Cash Solutions Loan Center on Murfreesboro Pike around noon.

Police said the gunman, Rivera, was a 39-year-old Hispanic man last known to have lived in Mt. Juliet. Police are trying to locate the man's next of kin, Metro Nashville Police spokesman Don Aaron said.

The man demanded money from a female employee and then took the employee outside and put a gun to her head, Aaron said.

When the employee wrestled control of the gun away from the man, the officer, Sgt. Scott Carter, fatally shot him, Aaron said.

Police are also investigating if the man was the same person who robbed the same Easy Cash store on May 23, Aaron said.

Carter came on the scene after an employee from Direct Auto Insurance, adjacent to Easy Cash, activated the silent alarm service. The Direct Auto employee saw the man park his maroon Toyota Avalon, leave the driver's door open and the car running and enter the Easy Cash store, Aaron said.The Easy Cash employee, 21, was the only person in the store at the time.

The insurance employee heard noises from the Easy Cash store. ""Something to the effect of, 'That's all I have,' or 'I don't have any more,' something along those lines,"" Aaron said.

Carter opened the door of the Easy Cash business, was immediately threatened, fired in self-defense and backed out of the business, according to Metro police.

The gunman then came out of the business with the employee, Aaron said.

""When he came out with his arm around her neck with a gun to her head, certainly Sgt. Carter was not expecting that. He gave commands, he was telling him to surrender, to drop the gun,"" Aaron said.

""This courageous 21-year-old lady saw an opportunity to free herself and did. Just as she was doing so, Sgt. Carter fired on the gunman to end the threat. The threat was ended at that point.""

The woman said the man went through cash drawers and demanded she open

the safe while threatening to kill her, according to Metro police.

Police later determined the gun was an air pistol.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — A Metro officer responding to a robbery alarm fatally shot an armed suspect as a female hostage wrestled away her captor’s gun.

Metro spokesman Don Aaron told News 2 that at 11:45 a.m., a robbery alarm was tripped by a Direct Auto Insurance employee.

Police said the suspect, identified as 39-year old Alexander Tirado Rivera, of Mt. Juliet, drove a 2007 Toyota Avalon into the Easy Cash Solutions Loan Center parking lot at 1128 Murfreesboro Pike. He stopped the vehicle in the middle of the lot, leaving his door open and engine running as he went inside the business.

The car’s license plate had been removed and was later found by officers on the passenger floorboard of the car.

An employee of Direct Auto Insurance, located next to the loan center, became suspicious when he saw how the man parked. After hearing what sounded like a struggle next door, he activated his silent robbery alarm.

South Precinct Sergeant Scott Carter was nearby and responded to the alarm call. Immediately noticing the strangely parked car, he cautiously approached Easy Cash Solutions.

When the Sergeant opened the front door of the business, he was immediately threatened at gunpoint by Rivera. Sgt. Carter fired in self-defense and backed out of the business.

Rivera followed, holding a 21-year-old female employee around the neck with a gun pointed to her head.

Sgt. Carter demanded that Rivera drop his weapon and surrender.

The woman believed she had an opportunity to free herself and began struggling with Rivera, and just as she was breaking away, Carter fired on the man, fatally wounding him.

The woman was unharmed and actually took the gun, an air pistol, from Rivera’s hand.

The victim, a new employee at Easy Cash Solutions, later told detectives that the masked and gloved gunman came into the business and demanded money. After going to cash drawers, Rivera demanded that she open the safe, all while threatening to kill her.

The same business was robbed of a “significant amount of cash” last Saturday at midday.

The gunman in that case was also masked and gloved. Detectives are now investigating whether last week’s robber and the one Saturday is the same person.

Sergeant Carter is a 17-year veteran of the MNPD.

 Officers shoot and kill homicide suspect
Buy Now
Travis Morisse/ The Hutchinson News
Police tape blocks off access to a home in the 800 block of North Van Buren Street Wednesday, June 23, 2015, where officers shot and killed a homicide suspect on Tuesday.
Officers rescued three small children out of the Hutchinson home of a homicide suspect just seconds before shooting the man, after they said he threw a knife and other objects at police.

Hutchinson Police Capt. Troy Hoover said the department received a call at 12:53 a.m. Tuesday from a man who had gone to the home in the 800 block of North Van Buren Street to check on the children.

The man arrived at the home where Jonathan P. Wilson, 22, was located, about 10 minutes before officers, Hoover said. When the man called police, he reported Wilson confessed to committing a murder − and he was armed with a knife.

Police suspect Wilson of killing Mary Ann Arnett, 38, of Hutchinson, whose body was found Monday in a creek near the intersection of 43rd Avenue and Riverton Road, just south of Nickerson.

More than a dozen Hutchinson police and Reno County Sheriff's deputies responded and surrounded the home, most armed with rifles.

Officers saw the children through the front door of the home and the window into the living room. Officers could hear the children crying and screaming and Wilson breaking objects, Hoover said.

Both agencies attempted to negotiate with Wilson for several minutes before deciding shortly after 1 a.m., based on the children's cries, to enter the home with a small team of officers and deputies.

They entered through the front door and went to where the children were in the living room.

“They were telling them (the children), 'Come to us; walk towards us,' and they grabbed them,” Hoover said. “Just seconds after they left is when the altercation occurred.”

Hoover said he wasn't clear on the relationship between Wilson, the man and the three children − ages 1, 3 and 6 − although the man who called police has ""some sort of family relations"" to the children.

He wasn't aware of any legal or family relationship between the children and Wilson, Hoover said.

As members of the rescue team picked up the children to take them out of the home, Wilson allegedly threw a kitchen knife and other objects at the officers, who then shot and killed Wilson.

He doesn’t know how many shots were fired or where Wilson was hit, Hoover said, although he confirmed the officers fired more than once. He also didn’t know the exact number of officers in the home.

Asked if Wilson was no longer a threat after he'd thrown the knife at the officers, Hoover said that would be up to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation to determine.

The Reno County Sheriff's Office and Hutchunson Police Department stated Wilson was “irate.”

Both officers who fired their weapons are on administrative leave until the KBI determines if the shooting was justified.

Photos: Hutchinson police shoot and kill man
HUTCHINSON, Kansas – New details in an officer-involved shooting in Hutchinson early Tuesday morning.

“We got a 911 call from someone who just left the house, saying the man confessed to killing a woman,” says Hutchinson Police Captain Troy Hoover. “That forced us to send a team of officers up to the residence, again, we tried to talk him into releasing the kids. He wouldn’t do it so the officers made their way inside the residence and funneled the kids outside of the house.”

That, Hoover says, is when Hutchinson police, backed up by officers from the Reno County Sheriff’s Department, shot and killed 22-year-old Jonathan Wilson at a home in the 800 block of North Van Buren.

Officers also said Wilson threatened officers and was breaking out windows. They say the suspect also began throwing items at the officers.

Police were able to safely get three kids out the home before shooting and killing Wilson.

“The officers… they were like, John, let the kids out,” says a neighbor, Jake Bugg. “One of the cops went in there with a riot shield and they were like, John, don’t move! And got one of the kids out, and when they proceeded into the house further they were like John, don’t move. Don’t move, John. And they get more aggressive with what they were saying. And, and finally you just hear them start firing. they just pop pop pop pop.”

Bugg says he recorded what he was hearing on his cell phone. And, while it was dark because it was the middle of the night, the cell phone audio clearly recorded what sounds like multiple shots fired.

“There were two officers that fired shots, yes,” says Hoover.

The two officers will now be on paid, administrative leave while the Kansas Bureau of Investigation reviews the facts in the case, and interviews witnesses. The officers each had three and nine years experience on the force in Hutchinson.

One man, who claimed to have been a witness, talked with KSN on the scene. The man says he was on the scene before police arrived. He did not want to talk on camera, but claims to have seen the entire incident from start to finish.

“All I can say is we are still interviewing people in this case,” says Hoover.

Hoover did say, however, that the officers that opened fire felt their lives were in danger.

“It’s a hard thing to have to do no matter who is involved, or how bad the suspect may be, we never want to have to take anybody’s life,” said Hoover.

Hoover also said the suspect threw what appeared to be “a butcher knife” at officers. KSN asked when officers fired shots.

“Mr. Wilson had thrown several objects at the officers including a knife,” says Hoover. “The shots were fired nearly simultaneously when the knife was thrown.”

Several other neighbors tell KSN they heard most all of the incident.

“It’s a little too close for comfort, so this just shook us up a little bit,” said Krytal Pritz, a neighbor.

Police investigators confirmed they do believe Wilson is tied to the homicide investigation in rural Reno County. A woman’s body was found in a creek in rural Nickerson. Officers have identified her as Mary Ann Arnett.

A 22-year-old man was shot and killed by Hutchinson police after a confrontation early Tuesday at the man’s house, authorities said.

Jonathan P. Wilson was shot and killed shortly before 1 a.m. in the 800 block of North Van Buren on the west side of Hutchinson by officers using patrol rifles, according to a statement released by the Hutchinson Police Department.

A caller to 911 said Wilson confessed to committing a murder and was armed with a knife, the statement said. Officers arriving at the house were confronted by Wilson, who was irate and threatened to harm them.

Three small children were in the house with Wilson, and the officers became concerned for their safety, said Hutchinson Police Capt. Troy Hoover. Wilson began breaking windows in the house.

As officers began removing the children, Wilson began throwing items – including a knife – at the officers, Hoover said. The officers responded by firing several shots, killing Wilson.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation into the shooting.

Reno County Sheriff Randy Henderson confirmed Wilson had been identified as a suspect in the death of a woman whose body was found in a small creek in northwest Reno County on Monday afternoon.

The woman was identified on Tuesday as 38-year-old Mary Ann Arnett of Hutchinson. Capt. Steve Lutz of the Reno County Sheriff’s Office said in an e-mailed statement that officers are still investigating the woman’s death.

About 13 Hutchinson city police and Reno County sheriff’s deputies responded at the home.

“Officers could hear (the children) crying and screaming, and him breaking things,” Hoover said. “We were concerned they were in danger.”

Hoover said one child was “very small,” and the other two are believed to be ages 3 and 4.

“He made comments such as, ‘If you want me, you’re going to have to come in and get me,’ ” Hoover said.

Hoover said two Hutchinson officers fired at Wilson “more than once,” but he did not know how many shots were fired or where Wilson was hit.

A man shot after he allegedly fired at a Sandpoint police officer and two Bonner County sheriff’s deputies on Tuesday also was accused of pulling a gun on law enforcement in 2007.

He was identified Wednesday as Casey G. Alarcon, 34.

The officer and deputies were “conducting enforcement activities” in the 1000 block of Ruth Avenue in Sandpoint when Alarcon began fighting with officers, according to the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office.

Alarcon pulled a gun and fired two shots, the Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. One of the deputies returned fire. Alarcon died on the way to a hospital. No officers were injured.

The confrontation was recorded by a body camera, the news release said. Officers involved have not been named.

Bonner County Prosecutor Louis Marshall said a search warrant related to the incident is sealed and likely will remain sealed until late next week.

The incident is being investigated by the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office.

Records indicate that Alarcon had a warrant for his arrest for allegedly failing to comply with his release conditions on a robbery charge.

In 2007 Alarcon was charged with three felonies stemming from an attempted robbery, according to court documents. After robbing a Sandpoint bar, he fled from the police and pulled a loaded 9 mm pistol when officers confronted him. Police wrestled him and removed the weapon.

Alarcon told police he was depressed and hoped they would kill him, the Bonner County Daily Bee reported in 2007. Alarcon was found guilty of robbery and possession of an unlawful firearm. An aggravated assault charge was dismissed.

Clackamas County Sheriff's officers shot and killed an armed man Sunday morning in Colton, a law enforcement source said.

The incident started with a call about a stabbing at a home. The caller hung up so deputies went to the scene to investigate.

The law enforcement official told The Oregonian/OregonLive that they used a loudspeaker to hail the home and a man came out, armed with a hatchet and a large screwdriver. They told him to put the weapons down, but he didn't, the source said.

Officers intended to use a beanbag gun to subdue him but before they could do that he charged toward them and they shot him.

The man died, the law enforcement official said.

This is second fatal officer-involved shooting in the area in less than a year. In July, a Clackamas County Sheriff's deputy killed a man in a domestic disturbance in Molalla.

No more details were available.

The Clackamas County District Attorney's Office will not present the case of a Colton man killed by deputies to a grand jury because the death was ruled a suicide, Chief Deputy District Attorney Greg Horner said.

On Feb. 15, Clackamas County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to a 911 call from a man claiming a person had been stabbed by someone who had a gun.

Deputies encountered Bruce Lee Steward when they arrived. Steward, 34, was holding a hatchet and refused the deputies' order to drop the weapon.

Steward was fatally shot by several deputies when he moved toward them with the hatchet, a Sheriff's Office spokesman said at the time.

The 911 call came from Steward's cell phone. Deputies did not find a stabbing victim.

The state Medical Examiner's office ruled that the death was a suicide, Chief Deputy DA Greg Horner.

In a prepared statement released Tuesday, Horner said:

""It is the long standing policy of the Clackamas County District Attorney's Office to present to the grand jury investigations of officer involved shooting deaths.

""However, this office has not submitted confirmed suicides to the grand jury for review. The shooting death of Bruce Lee Steward has been ruled a suicide by the Medical Examiner's office.

""Additionally, the law enforcement investigation supports this conclusion. As a result, this case will not be submitted to the grand jury for review.""

The deputies involved, Mark Nikolai, Scott McBride and Joshua Eagle, are back on duty.

Officers work the scene in the Amberly Square Apartments.
A man died after he was shot by Columbus police on the Far East Side Thursday night. 

Police were called about 9:25 p.m. to Brandy Drive in the Amberly Square Apartments, just south of Refugee Road and east of Noe-Bixby Road. 

No police officer was injured. The names of the man who was shot and police officers involved weren’t yet released. 

Sgt. David Pelphrey, spokesman for the Police Division, said the shooting occurred in the parking lot of the apartment complex after two officers who were working in the area pulled over a suspicious vehicle with three people in it. 

Shortly after stopping the car in the complex, one of the car’s occupants reached for a gun, Pelphrey said. He couldn’t say whether one or both officers fired their guns at him. 

Paramedics talking to a dispatcher at OhioHealth Grant Medical Center said the man who was shot was in his mid-20s and had been shot several times, including once in his head, once in his chest and once each in the shoulder and wrist. He died at 10:34 p.m. on Thursday at Grant. 

Pelphrey said the other two people who were in the car weren’t injured but taken into custody. No charges had been filed by early this morning. 

At one point, extra police were called to handle a crowd that had gathered at the shooting scene. At least one person reportedly was sprayed with chemical spray. 

The shooting occurred just south of another police shooting that happened this month. In that Oct. 15 shooting, SWAT Officer Barry Kirby fatally shot Kaleb R. Alexander, 25, just outside a United Dairy Farmers store at 2660 Noe-Bixby Rd. 

Kirby was one of the officers who had staked out the business after it had been robbed the previous two nights and Alexander reportedly was robbing it. 

When Alexander left the store, he ignored officers’ shouted commands to drop his gun and was shot, police said.

MUSKOGEE COUNTY, Oklahoma - A Warner man is dead after being tasered by police. The incident happened following a traffic incident before midnight Friday off Highway 64 near 158th Street in Muskogee County.

The man who died has been identified as 33-year-old David Cody Lynch. The identity of the officer who used the stun gun on him has yet to be released.

Since it is a Muskogee County case involving a Warner police officer, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation has been asked to take over the case.

The Muskogee County sheriff said it started when the officer was called to the scene of a possible traffic accident on Highway 64 in Muskogee County. Lynch may have been doing donuts in the middle of the road, Pearson said.

When the officer got on scene, the sheriff said the two got into a fight, and Lynch got the upper hand and ended up breaking the officer's eye bone. That's when the officer pulled out his Taser and used it. After handcuffing Lynch, the officer said he realized he wasn't moving or breathing.

""When something like this happens this is tragic to us, I would say most of us, 99 percent of us, are out here to make this a better place to live,” Pearson said. “He was going out there to lend aid and stand by until OHP got there. …For something like this to happen, you know it's hard on all if us, especially the officer that was there.

Update 4/5/15: OSBI has released the name of the man who died in Warner police custody.

They say 33-year-old David Cody Lynch of Warner was involved in a traffic accident just before midnight on Friday, April 3.

When a Warner police officer arrived on scene, they say Lynch assaulted the officer.

That’s when the officer tased the man.

After the officer had Lynch handcuffed, he noticed that Lynch was not breathing.

The investigation into the incident is ongoing.

 

WARNER, Okla. – The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) is investigating the death of a man who died in police custody.

The bureau says that a little after 1 a.m. Saturday morning, a Warner police officer responded to an traffic accident that occurred near Highway 64 and S. 158 St in Warner.

The driver of the vehicle involved in the accident allegedly assaulted the officer.

Authorities say the officer deployed his taser on the man and then handcuffed him.

The officer then noticed the man was not moving and not breathing.

The man was transported to a local hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.

The Muskogee County Sheriff’s Office has requested that OSBI investigate the death.

OSBI says agents arrived on the scene early this morning to collect evidence in the investigation.

When the bureau completes its investigation, an agent will deliver a report to the district attorney, who will determine if there was any wrongdoing on the part of the officer.

A medical examiner will perform an autopsy to determine the man’s cause of death.

The man’s name is being withheld until his family can be notified.

WARNER — A 33-year-old Warner man who died after being stun-gunned and then forcibly restrained by police in April suffered “asphyxia due to physical restraint,” according to a medical examiner’s report released Monday.
David Cody Lynch was prone after being stunned, and police officers were kneeling on him in an attempt to restrain him, which most likely caused an oxygen deficiency, the report states.
Lynch also had acute methamphetamine intoxication, hypertensive cardiovascular disease and a 0.12 blood alcohol concentration at the time he died, all of which are considered contributing factors, according to the report.
The state Medical Examiner’s Office report states that Lynch’s death is considered a homicide because although law enforcement did not intend to use deadly force, he died at least in part due to being intentionally restrained by an officer.
A Warner police officer responded to a traffic collision at U.S. 64 and 158th Street around 1 a.m. April 4 and reported getting into a scuffle with Lynch, who the officer said assaulted him. The officer, who was not identified, used his stun gun on Lynch and handcuffed him afterward, OSBI spokeswoman Jessica Brown said in a release at the time.
Lynch was taken to a hospital after the police officer and other responders at the scene realized he was not breathing. He was pronounced dead at a Muskogee hospital.
Muskogee County Sheriff Charles Pearson previously said Lynch fractured the officer’s eye socket and that the officer’s life was “definitely” in danger, meaning he could have used lethal force.

The force used by law enforcers that resulted with the death of man in April while he was in their custody was found to be justified by the Muskogee County District Attorney.

David Cody Lynch, 33, died while he was in police custody following a traffic stop near Warner. He was confronted by police officers from the Porum and Warner police departments and deputies with the Muskogee County Sheriff’s Office.

Orvil Loge ruled the actions of those officers were justified in a report released Thursday. According to the district attorney’s report, Lynch assaulted Warner Police Officer Michael Shamblin. The report alleges it took a Taser and the assistance of Lynch’s father to restrain Lynch and end the confrontation.

Lynch’s father jumped in the fray, putting his knee in his son’s back and saying, “Boy, give him your damn hand,” Loge states in the report.

According to a report from the Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office, Lynch died primarily from asphyxia due to physical restraint. He reportedly was under the influence of methamphetamine and alcohol the night he died.

The report lays out a timeline of events, stating Shamblin responded to a report of a collision at about 11:35 p.m. April 3 at the intersection of U.S. 64 and 158th Street South. When Shamblin arrived, he reportedly found two parked trucks, one of them belonging to Lynch.

Lynch reportedly was resistant to questioning and allegedly punched Shamblin in the face, fracturing his eye socket. Back-up did not arrive until about 11:50 p.m., according to the report.

During the ensuing struggle, Lynch allegedly punched Shamblin several more times. Lynch repeatedly yelled for bystanders to attack the officer, according to the report.

“Due to the situation, Officer Shamblin advised Lynch that if he didn’t comply with his directives, he was going to deploy his Taser,” Loge states. Lynch continued to fight and was subsequently Tased. He subsequently ripped one of the barbs out and continued to fight.

Shamblin reportedly told bystanders to call 911 “or he was going to have to shoot Lynch,” according to the report. A Muskogee County deputy and two Porum officers arrived shortly before midnight to assist. Lynch was in handcuffs by this point and being restrained by the Porum officers, according to the report.

“Lynch was still combative,” Loge states in the report. “He was yelling, cursing, he bit at Officer (Jack) Denny’s leg and attempted to grab Officer (Jerome) Wildcat’s firearm from his drop holster on two occasions.”

At 12:07 a.m. April 4, Lynch stopped breathing and officers reportedly attempted to resuscitate him. Emergency Medical Services were dispatched at 12:08 a.m.

Lynch was taken to EASTAR Health System, where he was pronounced dead. Physicians at the hospital noted “a large amount of black fluid coming from (his) mouth and nose,” according to the report

Loge ruled the killing justified, saying Lynch was operating a motor vehicle under the influence, assaulted and battered an officer, resisted arrest, obstructed officers and incited violence against an officer.

Loge concluded all the responding officers were “acting within the scope and course of employment as police officers on April 3 through April 4.”

Warner Police Chief Terry Thompson declined to comment do to pending civil litigation.

A Manitowoc County robbery suspect was shot and killed early Wednesday in a shootout with an Ashwaubenon police officer outside a hotel near Lambeau Field.

The exchange of gunfire happened about 1 a.m. after the officer stopped a car that matched the description of the suspect’s vehicle in the parking lot of the Quality Inn Stadium Area Hotel, 1978 Holmgren Way.

The driver got out his vehicle with a handgun and headed toward the hotel, according to the Ashwaubenon Public Safety Department. Both the suspect and officer fired shots, and the suspect was hit. The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he died.

The officer was not injured.

The robbery took place Monday evening at the KK Uni-Mart, 111 E. Church St., Mishicot.

Manitowoc Sheriff Robert Hermann said a man displaying a black handgun and wearing a puffy winter parka and two different colored tennis shoes made off with a bank bag and two boxes full of cash and coins.

Manitowoc County investigators identified the man and contacted him by telephone before notifying Ashwaubenon police that he was staying in an Ashwaubenon area hotel, Hermann said.

The Ashwaubenon police department has not released the name of either the officer or the suspect.

The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating the shooting.

TBI agents are investigating the fatal shooting of an armed man by a Carroll County sheriff's deputy on Friday night.

A deputy shot Matthew D. Belk, 27, after Belk got out of his car with a gun in his hand, a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman said today. No officers were injured in the incident.

The shooting occurred about 8 p.m. on Terry Road near its intersection with McCullough Road, just outside the town of McLemoresville.

Earlier in the evening, Carroll County sheriff's deputies responded to a domestic call at Belk's home, but Belk had left the house prior to the arrival of deputies, the TBI said. Deputies later saw and stopped Belk's car, which matched the description given by the complainant. That's when Belk got out of his car with the gun, the TBI said.

Investigators have not named the deputy who fired the shot that killed Belk.

The death of Steven B. Norton is under investigation by Texas Ranger Joel Kite, according to police, who said the four unidentified officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave.
A press release issued at 2:30 a.m. Monday said officers responded to a complaint at 10:54 p.m. Sunday by Norton’s wife that he had assaulted her and her daughter and armed himself with a rifle.
“The complainant fled the residence with her two children,” said the release issued by Officer Ben Eubank.
He said officers were unable to establish a dialogue with the suspect via telephone upon arriving at the scene and approaching the home on foot.
At 11:09 p.m., Eubank’s release said, “The male suspect stepped out on to the front porch of the residence with a rifle and fired a shot in the direction of the officers. All four officers returned fire with their duty weapons and the suspect was struck at least one time.”
The wounded suspect was flown to a San Antonio hospital, where he died, the release says. An autopsy has been ordered, said Eubank in a follow-up interview Monday.
Anyone with information about the incident is aksed to call Kerrville police at (830) 257-8181.

Kerrville police fatally shot Steven B. Norton, 47, on Aug. 16.
A grand jury determined the fatal shooting of a Kerrville man by police responding to a domestic violence call last summer was justified, authorities said.
Kerrville police said officers shot Steven B. Norton, 47, late on Aug. 16 after he fired on them from the porch of his home on Linda Joy Street.
Norton, who owned a local pest-control firm, later died at a San Antonio hospital. Kerr County grand jurors who examined the incident last week found no criminal conduct by police and concluded the officers’ use of deadly force was justified, Assistant District Attorney Lucy Wilke said Tuesday.
She said an investigation by Texas Ranger Kevin Wright didn’t identify which of four officers fired the fatal shot because the bullet had disintegrated. Wright declined to comment on the case.
Jennifer Norton had called police that night, saying her husband had assaulted her and her daughter and armed himself with a rifle.
The two left the home, and arriving officers were unable to establish dialogue with Norton. Police said he came outside and fired in their direction.
Police Chief David Knight called the grand jury findings welcome but not unexpected.
“It’s always a tragic circumstance when the actions of a citizen place our officers in a situation that requires the use of deadly force,” Knight said. “It’s not a tragedy only for the family of the citizen involved, but is also something that officers carry with them for the rest of their lives.”
Although Kerrville police reported that all four officers at the scene returned fire at Norton, the Department of Public Safety said Wednesday that Wright's investigation concluded that three officers shot a total of 12 bullets at Norton, striking him once in the lower back.
Kerrville police on Wednesday could not identify the three shooters from among the four officers, who the chief had identified as Sgt. Jonathan Lamb and officers Roy Alonzo, Daniel Haas and Stephen Wherry.
Jennifer Norton called the domestic problem that night an anomaly during their eight-year marriage, and said she, too, believes the actions by police were justified.
“Nothing like this had ever happened before. He was a good guy,” she said Tuesday. “The Police Department did what they were supposed to do.”
After the shooting, she learned from toxicology tests that her husband had used tranquilizers, including Ketamine, whose side effects include hallucinations, mood swings and confusion.
Jennifer Norton said she was unaware her husband was being prescribed the drugs found in his system.

“John Paul’s life matters,” said Santiago Quintero, his father. “It’s every parent’s worst nightmare. As a parent of a minority child, I did everything in my power I could to try to save John Paul that night.”

Santiago Quintero witnessed the incidents that unfolded Saturday in person, including the shots fired at his son.

He too, placed one of four 911 calls requesting help from the police.

CALLER: “They got two guys fighting inside the house. One is my son and the other’s um, my, my niece’s husband. They’re trying to stab each other and they not going to quite… I need some help. They are fighting and they don’t want to quit. Yes, they’ve got knives in their hands.”

DISPATCH: “Are there any other weapons?”

CALLER: “As far as I’ve seen it was just knives. They don’t want to quit. They keep talking __ to each other. I tried to stop it and I got pushed out and I don’t want to get in trouble with another family.”

“He was not perfect by any means, but he was my 23-year-old son,” continued Quintero.

Wednesday night’s candlelight vigil was not only about remembering the 23-year-old. Organizers and family members alike said it was also about seeking justice.

“We believe his death is about to be pushed under the rug,” explained Alina Quintero, John Paul’s cousin.

Area advocacy groups are fighting for a special prosecutor in this case.

“Prosecutors that are from that city or that county, they tend to have a fixed mindset on the outcome of these events. So, we wanted to get somebody from the outside that – so we can have a fair chance at seeking justice,” explained A.J. Bohannon, the president of I.G.Y.B., I Got Your Back organization.

Quintero’s family members made new allegations Wednesday night regarding particular detailed accounts of what they say happened in the seconds before John Paul was shot.

Santiago Quintero appeals to U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in the investigation involving the shooting death of his son, John Paul, 23, on January 4, 2015. 
Santiago Quintero appeals to U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in the investigation involving the shooting death of his son, John Paul, 23, on January 4, 2015.
Santiago Quintero also released a letter to the media (view the letter by clicking it) he wrote and sent to Eric Holder. In it, Quintero requests that the U.S. Department of Justice intervene in the investigation into the shooting death of his son.

In response to the following, as outlined in the letter:

“Finally, through tapes that have been obtained by a person close to the source we have learned that witnesses have been harassed by law enforcement here in Wichita.”
KSN asked for the tapes identified in the final paragraph of the letter, at left. We were told those tapes would not be released until the DOJ responds to Quintero’s letter.

As soon as the family receives a response, and those tapes are released, KSN News will provide that information on the air and online.

Further, Wichita Police released the transcripts and audio of four 911 calls placed on Saturday night relating to the incident. KSN has redacted some of the information due to privacy and/or protection concerns.

Wichita Police said they have not found the weapon or knife 911 callers referred to Saturday night, including as referenced to in the above call.

However, the officer-involved shooting remains under investigation.

DEMING – A Deming man shot and killed a woman Wednesday afternoon and was gunned down by Deming Police at the scene, according to a New Mexico State Police report.

State Police said the crime occurred around 3:30 p.m., outside a residence on south Country Club Drive. Deming Police answered a domestic disturbance call from central dispatch indicating a male suspect had reportedly shot his ""girlfriend,"" the report read.

When officers arrived at the scene they observed an unresponsive female lying outside the residence with an apparent gunshot wound. The woman was later identified by a family member as Andrea Perez, 32, of Deming.

According to Deming Police statements made to the state police, officers encountered the male suspect brandishing a firearm. The suspect, later identified as Florencio Lucero, 36, of Deming, threatened officers with his weapon and consequently was shot once by a Deming Police officer.

Officers at the scene rendered emergency medical aid to both Perez and Lucero. Lucero was transported to Mimbres Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Perez was transported to University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, where she later succumbed to her injuries.

The NMSP is investigating the officer-involved shooting and has taken the lead from the Deming Police Department in the case.

According to the Deming Police Department, the NMSP Investigations Bureau wrapped up the crime-scene investigation around 3:30 a.m. Thursday. The name of officers involved in the shooting will not be released until interviews have been conducted.

DEMING – The Deming Police Department has released the findings of the officer-involved shooting that occurred on Dec. 2, 2015. Upon the completion of the criminal investigation and independent review by the DA’s Office, Deming Police Lieutenant Enrique Granillo, an 18-year veteran of the department, was cleared of any wrong-doing for his actions on that day and the shooting was found to be justified and deemed lawful.

The fatal shooting took place at a trailer park located on Country Club Road in Deming around 3:30 p.m., outside a residence (travel trailer). Officers had been dispatched to a domestic dispute where 36-year-old Florencio Lucero Jr. had reportedly shot his girlfriend, 31-year-old Andrea Perez, outside a residence.

When officers arrived on scene they observed an unresponsive female lying outside the residence with an apparent gunshot wound. Officers had also encountered Florencio Lucero Jr., brandishing a firearm. Lucero was immediately given clear and concise verbal commands to drop the weapon, which he failed to follow. On several occasions Lucero pointed the weapon at officers on scene in a threatening manner, which led to the single shot being fired by Lt. Granillo.

Immediately after the shot being fired, medical attention was provided to both Perez and Lucero. Lucero was taken to Mimbres Memorial Hospital where he was later pronounced deceased. Perez was airlifted to University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, where she later succumbed to her injuries.

The New Mexico State Police (NMSP) was called upon to investigate the incident in its entirety, which is standard procedure and policy of the Deming Police Department when an officer is involved in a shooting incident.

Upon completion of the NMSP criminal investigation, the case was then submitted to the Sixth Judicial District Attorney’s Office for an independent review, which is also standard procedure. The DA’s office then completed a thorough review of the case by applying the Uniform Jury Instructions on Justification to Use Deadly Force, the New Mexico State Statute on Justifiable Homicide by Public Officer or Public Employee, applicable case law rulings and Deming Police Department Use of Force Policy and Procedures.

The Deming Police Department also conducted an Administrative Review of the case to ensure that all department policies and procedures were adhered to as well. The findings of that review led to the officer being cleared and subsequently returned to full active duty.",Yes,No,,No,,http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a94aaab8e826ca8563bd0e434c9fe36f1dc920f/c=0-0-399-300&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/25/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635787730586319408-DFP-1017-police-pix-1-1-Q18RNJ55-L502734387.JPG,No,,,,,,,,,,3:30 PM,Outdoors,Residence,,Victim made voluntary contact with the police (eg. called for assistance),,Homicide,,None of the above,,Yes,Unclear,Yes,No,"Disobey or ignore police orders,Point weapon at officer,Threaten officer with weapon",,Issue verbal commands,,Pointed gun at officer,,,,Exact number given.

TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) -
The Tucson Police Department has confirmed the man shot by officers during a midtown officer-involved shooting Saturday afternoon has died.

Sgt. Pete Dugan, a department spokesman, said the man was struck multiple times by two TPD officers. Dugan said the officers involved in the shooting were officer Brendon Brumitt, a 4-year veteran with the department and Matthew Gustafson, who's been with the department for more than a year.

Dugan said the man's name is being withheld until detectives finish speaking with potential witnesses.

In a news release, Dugan said their homicide unit will conduct a criminal investigation into the incident and their Office of Internal Affairs will conduct a separate administrative investigation to examine the actions of the officers.

The shooting happened on North Stone Avenue and West Prince Road shortly after 5 p.m. at the exact same address as a homicide that happened Friday night.

Dugan said when officers got on the scene, they approached the man and a woman when the man suddenly tried running away and gunfire was exchanged.

He was then sent to Banner University Medical Center.

Dugan said he's unsure if this incident is related to Friday night's homicide but said that's what they're hoping to find out.

""Even the person that called us thought it was suspicious that we've had two people standing right near where a shooting had taken place the night before,"" Dugan said. ""It appeared they were looking around the ground so, we wanted to come out here and see a couple things.""

A man who was shot and killed by Tucson police Saturday after he exchanged gunfire with officers was the shooter in a homicide that occurred Friday on the city's northwest side, police said.

Armando Serrano Jr., 29, who later died at Banner-University Medical Center Tucson, was the shooter in the slaying of Richard Fries, 26, at a mobile home park at 38 W. Prince Road, west of North Stone Avenue, said Sgt. Pete Dugan.

On Friday, officers were sent to the mobile home park about 11:30 p.m. to check on a man who was lying in the parking lot. When they arrived they found Fries was fatally shot. 

Forensic evidence and witness statements led detectives to determine that Serrano shot Fries, said Dugan, a police department spokesman.

The shooting of Serrano Saturday happened near the site of the slaying.

On Saturday shortly before 5 p.m., TPD Officers Brendon Brumitt and Matthew Gustafson responded to a call of suspicious activity at the mobile home park where the slaying occurred.

According to the caller, a man and woman could be seen near where the fatal shooting took place, and were looking around the area. When police tried to make contact, the man ran away. During the short chase, the officers and Serrano exchanged gunshots, said Dugan.

The Washington County Sheriff's Office has identified the Aloha man who was fatally shot by sheriff's deputies early Friday.

Lewis Lee Lembke, 47, was shot while deputies responded to a domestic violence call.

Sgt. Bob Ray, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, said three deputies were in an apartment in the Masters Apartments, located in the 4500 block Southwest Masters Loop, around 2:20 a.m. after Lembke's wife reported that her husband had choked and assaulted her.

Authorities had been in the apartment minutes earlier after Lembke's wife reported that her husband had possibly overdosed on alcohol. The deputies assisted Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue in the attempted treatment on Lembke, Ray said. As Lembke became more lucid, he refused further treatment. Deputies and paramedics left the home at 2:17 a.m.

After Lembke's wife reported the assault, she locked herself in the bathroom until the deputies arrived and moved her to safety, Ray said. When deputies attempted to contact Lembke, he emerged from the bedroom doorway and was holding a semi-automatic handgun, Ray said.

Deputies told Lembke to drop his gun, and Lembke pointed the handgun directly at the deputies, Ray said. Deputies shot Lembke, and then began CPR until paramedics arrived. Lembke was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Washington County Major Crimes Team is investigating. The team is assisted by the Oregon State Police Forensics Unit and Washington County Forensics Science unit.

The deputies have been placed on administrative leave during the investigation. The names of the deputies involved are expected to be released next week when the investigation is complete, Ray said.

A Washington County sheriff's deputy was justified in fatally shooting an Aloha man armed with a handgun during a domestic violence investigation in January, the District Attorney's Office said Thursday.

Deputy Kenneth Coon fired four rounds at 47-year-old Lewis Lee Lembke, according to a letter from Senior Deputy District Attorney Bracken McKey to Sheriff Pat Garrett.

Lembke, who had pointed a handgun at the deputy, was struck twice. He was shot within a minute of deputies arriving at the apartment he shared with his wife, the letter said.

""Based upon my review of this investigation, I conclude that Deputy Coon acted under the reasonable belief that Mr. Lembke was 'using or about to use unlawful deadly physical force' against Deputy Coon and the other deputies,"" McKey wrote. ""Deputy Coon was justified in responding with deadly force against the threat posed by Mr. Lembke.""

McKey's letter gave the following account of what happened:

The shooting occurred Jan. 2 after deputies arrived for the second time in a little over an hour at the apartment.

Coon, along with Deputy Zackery Vance and Reserve Deputy Michael Trotter, initially went to the Masters Apartments, 4519 S.W. Masters Loop in Aloha, at 1:12 a.m. Lembke's wife, Harriet, had reported he was drunk, throwing up and unresponsive.

The deputies responded with firefighters and paramedics, who wanted Lembke to go to the hospital. During the encounter, Lembke regained consciousness and refused further medical treatment. He did not meet the requirement for police to put him under a protective hold.

McKey described Lembke as belligerent and confrontational with medics. During the initial reports after the incident, the sheriff's office said that the first encounter between deputies and Lembke was not hostile.

The deputies and firefighters left about 2:15 a.m., McKey wrote. About five minutes later, Harriet Lembke had locked herself in the bathroom and called 911 again, this time reporting that her husband had choked her and thrown her down. He had threatened to kill her if she called police again, according to the letter.

Harriet Lembke stayed on the line until a dispatcher told her that deputies were at the front door.

As Harriet Lembke walked down the hallway to open the door and passed her husband, he told her, ""I'm going to kill you,"" McKey wrote.

The same three deputies approached the front door at 2:26 a.m., according to the letter. They tried to talk to Lewis Lembke. But he walked toward deputies and ignored commands to drop his loaded 9mm Smith & Wesson pistol.

Lewis Lembke raised the gun and pointed it at Coon, McKey wrote. Coon then fired. At 2:27 a.m., deputies reported that shots had been fired.

Lewis Lembke died at the scene.

An autopsy determined Lewis Lembke died of a gunshot wound to his chest. McKey wrote that his blood-alcohol level was .16 at the time of the autopsy.

The Washington County Major Crimes Team investigated the shooting. Deputies involved in the shooting were interviewed nearly a week afterward.

During the investigation, authorities found that the area below the muzzle of Lewis Lembke's gun was damaged ""from an apparent bullet strike,"" McKey wrote, citing a report from the state crime lab. A bullet jacket fragment was also found embedded in the gun's frame.

That evidence, McKey wrote, shows that one of the deputy's rounds struck Lembke's gun while the pistol was pointed ""directly at Deputy Coon.""

It was the first officer-involved shooting and homicide in Washington County this year.

CAMDEN – For more than a year, in hundreds of calls involving people armed with guns, Camden County police didn't fire their weapons at a suspect.

That streak ended late Friday night, when two officers fatally shot a distraught 33-year-old man who aimed a handgun at them in an apparent act of ""suicide by police"" after telling a 911 operator he wanted to die in a shootout, authorities said.

The deadly confrontation around 11:20 p.m. in the city's Cramer Hill neighborhood capped a particularly dramatic week for the Camden County Police Department in which one officer was shot by a suspect and two other officers arrested a man walking around the city with a loaded handgun tucked in his waistband.

It marks only the third time in the department's history that officers have fired at a suspect who was threatening them. And it comes at a time when the department has been proudly touting its restraint in confronting armed suspects, amid growing nationwide outrage over police-involved killings.

Authorities identified the man killed Friday as Oscar Camacho of Camden. He was suicidal and intentionally prompted officers to shoot him, county spokesman Dan Keashen said. A 911 recording released Saturday by county police backs up that account.


In the call that Camacho made minutes before his death, he tells a dispatcher that he had been drinking ""a lot"" before crashing his Honda Civic into some parked cars at River and Lois avenues.

""I'm done. I'm done with my life,"" Camacho tells a dispatcher, adding that he has three boys.

Soon afterward, Camacho says, ""I'm not going to get locked up for this,"" and then makes makes a chilling challenge that police say came true a few minutes later.

""I'm going to come at the cops, like I said. Whatever. If you want to go and do a shootout, whatever. It is what it is,"" Camacho tells the dispatcher, who urges him to remain calm and says authorities will get him help.

Within a few minutes, police located his unoccupied vehicle at Bergen and Harrison avenues. That's where Camacho approached officers while aiming a loaded handgun at them, Keashen said.

The two officers fired their weapons, killing Camacho, according to Keashen. A gun was recovered from the dead man's hand, he said. Authorities did not say how many shots were fired.

The Camden County Prosecutor's Office and the state Attorney General's Office are investigating the shooting.

Keashen said the officers involved in the encounter, whom officials did not identify, were placed on administrative duty. That's a normal police department policy for such incidents, he said.

Camacho should not have been able to obtain a gun, authorities said. He was prohibited from possessing a firearm because of a previous conviction for drug dealing, according to Keashen.

The deadly confrontation occurred just 48 hours after Camden County Police Officer Prince Reed was shot while on duty in the city's Parkside section.

Camden resident Victor Bennett fired several rounds at Reed's police car, and a bullet fragment struck the officer in the forearm, police said. Reed did not return fire.

Suspect captured in shooting of Camco officer

It was the only time a Camden County police officer has been shot in the line of duty since the department was created. Police said Bennett was arrested Friday afternoon, armed with a semiautomatic handgun while hiding in a shed behind a Collingswood home, at the end of a manhunt involving county and federal authorities.

The last time someone was killed in a police-involved shooting in Camden County was in January, when authorities said an officer responding to a tense domestic dispute in Winslow shot a man aiming a handgun in his direction.

The fatal confrontation that occurred Friday night was only the second time in the 26-month history of the Camden County Police Department that an officer has fired a gun while responding to an incident involving a suspect with a gun. In April 2014, an armed man was wounded during a gunfight with county police outside the Chestnut Court apartment complex.

In recent news releases, county police had been touting their record of handling dangerous situations involving armed individuals without officers needing to discharge their weapons.

The county police department was launched May 1, 2013, replacing a city-run force that was deemed inadequate. Since then, county officers responded to 4,212 calls involving someone with a gun, made 511 arrests and recovered 489 illegal firearms, according to department statistics updated June 30.

Police officials described their actions over the past two years as evidence of their commitment to showing restraint even under the most trying of circumstances.

For example, in an incident Tuesday afternoon, police saw 24-year-old Jemere Burch of Camden walking near 9th and Ferry avenues with a loaded Lorcin L380 handgun in his waistband, authorities said in a news release. Officer Joseph Olivio and Detective Lucas Murray ""worked together to mitigate the potential danger to others in the area by tactically approaching Burch and ordering him to the ground,"" the release said.

""The officers who responded to this call neutralized the threat to public safety by following their training, which prioritizes safety and the sanctity of life,"" Deputy Chief Joseph L. Williams said. ""They showed true professionalism and restraint in resolving this potentially dangerous situation without incident.""

Last month, two officers arrested a drunken man who was standing at 8th and Elm streets while brandishing a defaced .45-caliber Regent 1911-A1 handgun with an extended magazine loaded with hollow point bullets, police said. They quickly disarmed him and made an arrest without any injuries, police said.

""The professionalism displayed by officers (Timothy) Miller and (Jose) Vale in handling this incident,"" Williams said, ""is reflective of the ongoing training provided to officers on how to respond to potentially dangerous situations with restraint and a clear focus on ensuring the safety of officers, residents and suspects.""

Keashen said county police have discharged a weapon on eight occasions in the department's history, mostly to defend against rabid dogs. In one instance, a man was shot and wounded after trying to run over officers with a car.

A nationwide analysis by The Washington Post found 466 other people — more than two per day — have been fatally shot by police in the line of duty so far this year, including nine in New Jersey. About one in four people killed was believed to suffer from mental illness, according to the analysis.

UPDATE: Listen to 911 call of suicidal Camden man before officer involved shooting

CAMDEN — A Camden man was shot and killed by police Friday night after threatening to shoot the officers, aiming a gun at them and saying he would take his own life.

Camden County officials said the incident began after the suspect, a Hispanic male in his 30s, called 911 from his car, said he had a gun and wanted to die and threatened the police. 

When officers arrive in the Cramer Hill section of the city, they found the man's car unoccupied near Bergen and Harrison Avenue. As the officers got out of the patrol car, the suspect approached them with a gun pointed at them, officials said. Two officers fired shots at the man, killing him. 

Police said they recovered a loaded gun from the man's hand after the shooting. While the man's name was not released, officials said he had a criminal record including drug distribution and was barred from owning a weapon. 

An independent investigation into the police-involved shooting will be conducted by the Camden County Prosecutor's Office and the Attorney General's Office, which is standard procedure. 

The officers involved, whose names were not yet released, will be placed on administrative duty, which is department policy.

Police said more information will be provided.

CAMDEN — Two Camden police officers who shot and killed a suicidal man armed with an air rifle last year were justified in their use of deadly force, according to the findings of an independent investigation.

The Camden County Prosecutor's Office released a statement Tuesday outlining the details of the July 3, 2015 fatal shooting of 33-year-old Oscar Camacho Jr., including statements Camacho made about being ""done with life"" and wanting to ""go in a shootout"", as well as its decision to not charge the officers involved or present the case to a grand jury.

The office released the information as part of a state Attorney General's directive regarding fatal police-involved shootings and said the state's Division of Criminal Justice reviewed the case and agreed with their findings. 

Camacho called 911 at about 11 p.m. on that Friday night and told the dispatcher he had ""crashed a lot of cars"" in the area of Bergen and Harrison avenues, had a gun and wanted to kill himself. 

""I don't want nobody to come at me... I'm gonna come at the cops like I said, whatever, and we're gonna go in a shootout, whatever... it is what it is,"" Camacho said, telling the dispatcher later that he was ""not gonna get locked up ... I prefer them to shoot me.""



According to the prosecutor's office's statement, a homeless man known by residents to hang out in the area saw Camacho arrive at the area and get out of his car carrying what looked like a gun prior to police arriving on scene. 

Three police officers, who had a description of Camacho's car and were informed he was armed, arrived in two separate vehicles. Two officers approached the homeless man, thinking it was Camacho, while a third, a uniformed sergeant, stayed near his vehicle and saw Camacho walking to a home on Harrison Avenue.

Camacho's brother and two friends were at the home as the incident unfolded. The friend who opened the door told authorities Camacho shook his hand and said, ""I love you, bro,"" before walking away. The other friend heard Camacho say, ""Tell everybody I love them."" Camacho's brother reported hearing, ""Guys, I love you.""

As Camacho came down from the home's front porch, the officers who were speaking with the homeless man said Camacho walked toward them carrying a black gun with a brown handle and long barrel that was pointed to the ground.

Brendan Creato, 3, was found partially submerged in the Cooper River in October 2015.

The officers immediately ordered Camacho to drop the weapon, but said Camacho didn't comply and continued walking toward the officers. When he was about 10 to 20 feet away, he pointed the weapon at one officer, who then took cover behind an SUV next to him. 

The second officer drew his weapon in response and took cover behind his patrol car as both ordered him to drop the gun and the sergeant ordered him on the ground. Neighbors outside at the time reported hearing the commands and seeing Camacho draw an object from his waist during the confrontation

When Camacho didn't drop the weapon — which turned out to be a .22 Crosman Arms Co2 revolver — the sergeant fired 16 shots at Camacho, hitting him ""multiple times."" The officer who was behind the SUV thought he was being fired upon so he leaned out from behind the vehicle and fired one shot at Camacho. 

The prosecutor's statement said the investigation led them to determine the officers acted as necessary to protect themselves and because no material facts were disputed, the case would not go before a grand jury. The Division of Criminal Justice agreed with the prosecutor's office on both decisions.

CRAB ORCHARD — Howard Robbins may have been retired, but retirement hadn’t slowed him down.

The 69-year-old Crab Orchard resident was a common sight along the city’s roads, where he would often be seen walking or riding his lawn mower to and from his tiny house on Duval Lane, said his son, Brian.

“Anything to stay busy,” Brian said. “His belief was he only needed three hours a day for sleep.""

According to family members, Robbins was out walking the night of Jan. 15, heading for a friend’s home across U.S. 150 when a vehicle traveling west on the highway struck and killed him.

The vehicle was a Stanford Police Department cruiser, driven by officer Travis Richardson, 33, of Crab Orchard. Richardson was on his way to Stanford to begin a night shift when the collision occurred about 9:30 p.m.

After the collision, Richardson immediately notified the local 911 dispatch center and began trying to administer first aid to Robbins, according to information from Kentucky State Police.

Richardson attempted CPR, but Robbins had “died instantaneously” from the impact, Lincoln County Coroner Farris Marcum said.

Robbins' body was taken to Fort Logan Hospital, where Marcum pronounced him dead at 10:45 p.m.

An autopsy was performed Friday to verify cause of death as multiple blunt force trauma injuries, Marcum said.

As is standard procedure for incidents like this, a toxicology screen will be performed to determine if there were any drugs or medications in Robbins’ system. But investigators expect the screen to come back clean, Marcum said.

KSP Trooper Jeff Stith is investigating the incident and accident reconstruction is currently under way, KSP spokesman Robert Purdy said.

“We’ve got a pretty good idea of where the victim was (when he was hit), but until we absolutely 100-percent verify that, we don’t want to release that,” Purdy said.

Some of Robbins' six children placed a cross and flowers to mark the scene earlier this week.

Stanford Police Chief Zach Middleton said officer Richardson has been placed on administrative leave “until he’s emotionally ready to come back to work.""

“It was a tragic incident and we are going to wait until state police finish their investigation before we comment any further, but our thoughts and our condolences are with the friends and family,” Middleton said.

Howard Robbins
Robbins lived in Crab Orchard earlier in his life before moving to Michigan, where he worked for General Motors in Detroit, according to family members.

He retired from GM and moved back to Crab Orchard, where he had been working odd jobs and planning for a restoration of a large building on his property, said his daughter, Mona Lisa.

Robbins had 15 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren in addition to his three daughters and three sons, Mona Lisa said. He was divorced, but his ex-wife still still took care of him, she added.

Mona Lisa said her father was a religious man and hard worker whom she hopes will be remembered for his bottomless energy.

“I wish I had his energy at his age. He’s 69 years old and he’d get up at 2 o’clock in the morning to do something,” she said. “He lived a simple life. He didn’t need much to make him happy. He loved his kids and his grandkids. That was his life, besides the Lord.""

The funeral was Wednesday.

CRAB ORCHARD – A Stanford police officer was speeding when his cruiser struck and killed a Crab Orchard pedestrian on Jan. 15, according to a Kentucky State Police investigation report.
Four months after the fatal pedestrian wreck, a KSP collision analysis acquired by the Interior Journal through an open records request, reveals Stanford officer Travis Richardson, 33, of Crab Orchard, was traveling 90 mph in a 55 mph zone when his issued 2008 Ford Crown Victoria struck and killed Howard Robbins, 69, of Crab Orchard.
Robbins, who was pronounced dead at Fort Logan Hospital in Stanford at 10:45 p.m., was walking across U.S. 150, just before Duvall Lane, when his body was hit and thrown to the south shoulder of the road, according to the reconstruction report.
Richardson was on his way to work in Stanford and a camera inside his cruiser captured the collision, which investigators used to reconstruct the scene and determine the high rate of speed at which he was traveling.
The camera, which Richardson ""removed from the vehicle shortly after the collision,"" also shows Robbins was “clearly in the east bound lane of traffic,” the report states.
Investigators said Richardson did not slam on the brakes immediately and although he did engage them, no marks were left on the roadway. A blood stain from Robbins’ body was found on the south shoulder about six feet from the road.
Distraction was ruled a non-issue by investigators after Richardson’s phone records were subpoenaed and gave no indication that he was texting or talking on the phone at the time of the collision. Audio from the video camera also confirmed no phone conversations took place before or during the wreck.
The investigation was conducted by KSP Trooper Jeff Stith with assistance from Danville Police Department Detective Robert Ladd, who has been an accident reconstructionist for 12 years and helped determine the speed at which Richardson was traveling.
“Using reference points on the roadway and the point of impact we were able to determine a speed for the vehicle,” the report states.
Although Richardson was placed on administrative leave following the incident, he returned to work on Feb. 2.
Commonwealth’s Attorney Eddie Montgomery has declined prosecution due to lack of criminal activity involved in the case, aside from speeding, he said.
""I just don’t think there’s enough there to charge him as a criminal. There was speed but there was no alcohol or drugs. I don’t think there’s enough there to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt of a criminal offense. Now there might be a civil offense,” Montgomery said.
Richardson’s toxicology report was not included with the collision analysis but it does state that he voluntarily traveled to Fort Logan Hospital for a chemical blood test.
Questions still remain as to why Richardson was traveling 35 miles over the speed limit when his shift had not yet started and he was off-duty at the time.
Montgomery said the reason he looked at the case was because of the high rate of speed but he still decided there wasn’t enough reason to charge Richardson with a criminal offense.
Stanford Mayor Eddie Carter said the incident is a “touchy situation” that he can’t really comment on at this time.
Carter said a hearing for Richardson will be held on June 30 and will be left up to Richardson whether or not it is public or private.
Stanford Police Chief Zach Middleton declined to comment while the process is still ongoing but expressed his disappointment in the situation.",Yes,No,,No,,http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/centralkynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/01/2018e616-0bce-11e5-ac0a-8f73b47fa1d1/55721bff7044d.image.jpg?resize=300%2C300,No,,,,,,,,,,9:30 PM,Outdoors,Street/Road,,Other,Victim was struck by cop vehicle,None of the above,,None of the above,,No,No,No,No,None of the above,,None of the above,,Officer broke traffic laws,,,,Death not by gunshot,,,,,Exact number provided.

PALM BEACH GARDENS — Update, 2:30 p.m.: Family members plan to gather this evening at Bible Church of God in Boynton Beach to speak about Corey Jones, the 31-year-old killed by a Palm Beach Gardens police officer early Sunday.

COREY JONES SHOOTING: GET THE LATEST UPDATES

Jones’ grandfather, Bishop Sylvester Banks, and other family members work at the church. Several loved ones of Jones plan to gather and share memories of the local drummer, said Jones’ cousin Remus Johnson.

“We’re really numb right now, just trying to understand what happened,” Johnson said.

Corey Jones’ brother, Clinton Jones Jr., heard from Corey just after car issues left him stranded on the off-ramp of Interstate 95 southbound at PGA Boulevard at about 3 a.m. Sunday, family members say.

The family wasn’t notified of the fatal shooting until about 6 p.m., Johnson said.

Update 1:55 p.m.: The Palm Beach Gardens police officer who shot Corey Jones Sunday has been identified as Nouman Raja.

Raja was on duty in an unmarked police vehicle early Sunday morning when he came across Corey Jones and his disabled car on the Interstate 95 southbound exit ramp at PGA Boulevard.

Raja, who was in plain clothes, believed Jones’ vehicle was abandoned and stopped to investigate it, according to a statement released by police Monday afternoon. As Raja exited his vehicle, “he was suddenly confronted by an armed subject,” the statement says.

“As a result of the confrontation,” Raja fatally shot Jones.

Update, 12:45 p.m.: The last time Mathew Huntsberger saw drummer Corey Jones was after their band finished a gig at a Jupiter bar Saturday night and Jones’ SUV was stalled on the Interstate 95 exit ramp at PGA Boulevard early Sunday morning.

Future Prezidents’ gig at Corner’s Ocean Bar and Grill in Jupiter had finished about 1:20 a.m. and Huntsberger had already made it home when he got a call from Jones saying he was having car trouble, Huntsberger told The Palm Beach Post on Monday.

Huntsberger, 34, met Jones on the exit ramp where Jones, 31, told him the car started having trouble while on Interstate 95, and then he pulled over to the nearest exit. He made it to the ramp and then pushed his car toward the end of it. He thought maybe the car needed oil, so Huntsberger got some for him. It didn’t help.

Jones called for At&T Roadside Assistance, and Huntsberger decided because he couldn’t help he’d head home.

That was about 2:30 a.m., about 45 minutes before the shooting.

What happened in those 45 minutes is not known.

Palm Beach Gardens Police has not commented on what led up to the shooting. Police also have not confirmed the identity of the person who was shot.

“I guess I was the last one to see him,” Huntsberger said. “He was like a really peaceful guy. There’s no way he had a gun. We’re all musicians and stuff. We’re not violent people.”

Original story: Family of 31-year-old Corey Jones confirmed this morning that he was the victim of an officer-involved shooting early Sunday in Palm Beach Gardens.

Police haven’t released his name or the name of the Palm Beach Gardens police officer who fatally shot Jones at 3:15 a.m. on the Interstate 95 southbound exit ramp at PGA Boulevard.

Jones, a Boynton Beach resident, was a local drummer, his uncle Martin Jones said this morning.

“It’s such a tragedy. He’s a really good kid,” Martin Jones said.

Palm Beach Gardens police turned the investigation over to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, according to Gardens police spokeswoman Ellen Lovejoy.

 Save for later
The plainclothes police officer who shot dead a 31-year-old black man in southern Florida was threatened with suspension at his previous department after holding on to prescription drugs that he seized from a suspect.

Palm Beach Gardens officer Nouman Raja, who killed Corey Jones, was reprimanded by commanders at Atlantis police department for being “derelict in the performance of his duties” by repeatedly mishandling evidence and paperwork, according to his disciplinary file.

Pills confiscated by Raja from a woman who obtained them without a prescription in January 2013 were discovered in Raja’s patrol car more than a week later. “Officer Raja said he never did the report and he never secured the evidence,” his sergeant wrote in the file.

The file was released by the Atlantis police chief, Robert Mangold, on Tuesday and first published by the author Ray Downs, as county investigators looked into Raja’s fatal shooting of Jones on an exit ramp of interstate 95 in the early hours of Sunday morning. Police union leaders warned the city was risking “another Ferguson” by withholding information.

Jones’s family has recruited Benjamin Crump, the prominent civil rights lawyer who represented the families of Michael Brown and Tamir Rice after they were killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, and Cleveland, Ohio, last year. In a statement released through Crump on Tuesday the family said Jones had “dedicated his life to doing the right thing”.

“He lived every moment to the fullest and was an inspiration to many; the kind of son, brother and friend people could only hope for,” they said.

At a press conference, the Palm Beach Gardens police chief, Stephen Stepp, reiterated police claims that Raja, who had arrived in an unmarked police car, fired after being threatened by Jones. Police allege Jones was holding a pistol later found beside his car. “As the officer exited his vehicle he was suddenly confronted by an armed subject,” said Stepp.

Friends and relatives of Jones argue that the police account does not make sense and say he must not have known that Raja, who is 38 and was not wearing a uniform, was a police officer.

Family members said the 31-year-old, who played the drums, sent a text message saying he was waiting with his vehicle after it broke down on his return from a concert. They said he had a gun and a permit for carrying a concealed firearm for his job as a housing inspector for a public authority, but insisted he would never have threatened anyone with the weapon.

Stepp released little new information on Tuesday, citing an ongoing external investigation by the Palm Beach county sheriff’s office. He resisted requests from reporters to describe in more detail the interaction between Raja and Jones that preceded the shooting. Stepp said there was no dashboard camera footage of the incident and that no Palm Beach Gardens officers used body-mounted cameras.

Stepp said that at the time of the incident, around 3.15am, Raja had been working in a plainclothes detail assigned to tackle a recent spate of burglaries in the area.

Paperwork indicated that Jones had legally purchased his gun three days before Raja shot him, Stepp said on Tuesday. As well as finding the handgun outside his car, officers discovered the box in which the gun was purchased inside the car, according to Stepp.

The police chief expressed condolences to Jones’s family but said he had not yet been able to meet them.

Raja worked for Atlantis police between 2008 and 2015, according to department records, before he was hired by the Palm Beach Gardens department in April. Stepp said the officer had no disciplinary issues since then.

His Atlantis file showed, however, that internal inquiries into his failure to submit evidence or paperwork in the prescription drugs case – which resulted in a lack of prosecution – also turned up several other unfiled reports from various other cases to which he had been assigned. His sergeant, whose name was unclear from a signature, wrote that Raja accepted he had been at fault and took responsibility.

“Officer Raja is to be put on notice that any future incidents of this nature will result in a suspension,” wrote the sergeant, who recommended a written reprimand. The report and recommendation were approved and signed by Mangold, the chief.

Jones’s grandfather, Sylvester Banks Sr, addressed reporters after the press conference on Tuesday and thanked the public for their support. “I believe the best thing that can ever come out is the truth,” Banks said.

Banks also urged supporters to remain peaceful as information about the shooting is released. Palm Beach Gardens officers have reportedly received death threats since Jones died. The department’s Facebook page was deactivated because of “numerous posts containing profanity and negative racial comments”, officials said.

Stepp scheduled Tuesday’s press conference after repeated criticisms over the lack of information the department had released about the shooting.

Even the president of Palm Beach county’s police union called on the department to be more transparent in its handling of the case. “You don’t want another Ferguson, where they sat on information for days, and it seems like this is what Gardens is doing,” John Kazanjian said.

Acknowledging the combustible atmosphere, Stepp said on Tuesday: “I understand the public’s concern – we share that.”

The chief said the Palm Beach county sheriff’s office had asked him not to release material such as recordings of 911 calls or radio transmissions, photographs, notes “in order to maintain the integrity of the investigation”.",Yes,Yes,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/21/1445392536049/a0db3620-fc11-4ce3-b965-dc6254937ebf-1020x612.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=ec2c1151a8375e08a85f03cbbf13e6d6,No,,NONE,Yes,http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article41212614.html,FBI joins probe into Corey Jones’ police shooting case," OCTOBER 23, 2015 4:02 PM

ORDER REPRINT OF THIS STORY
Two days after the Palm Beach County state attorney said he didn't need any help investigating the police shooting death of Corey Jones, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw has asked the FBI for assistance.

In a tweet sent out late Friday afternoon, Bradshaw said he requested the federal law enforcement agency's help, because, “there is nothing more important, now, than a comprehensive investigation process so we can ensure justice is served.”

The FBI confirmed Friday night it will help investigate the shooting death of Jones.

On Wednesday, State Attorney Dave Aronberg rejected a call by the community, Jones’ family members and the state's legislative Black Caucus for an outside investigator, saying his office would conduct a ""independent and thorough investigation."" Earlier Wednesday, Gov. Rick Scott had offered the help of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to look into Jones’ death but Aronberg declined the offer.

Calls to Benjamin Crump, the attorney for the Jones family, were not returned Friday evening. Crump and the family had requested an independent investigation after meeting with Aronberg Thursday morning, and again at a rally Thursday afternoon in remembrance of Jones.

Edwin Narain, D-Tampa, chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, endorsed the FBI’s involvement: ""I think it's a very positive development and it sends the right signal that the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office wants to have as much transparency in the process. It should help restore public confidence.""

Jones, 31, a Boynton Beach musician, was shot dead at 3 a.m. Sunday on a grassy swale on the side of I-95 by Palm Beach Gardens Detective Nouman Raja. Jones’ silver Hyundai had broken down off the highway at the PGA Boulevard exit while he was returning to Boynton Beach from a gig with his band Future Prezidents in Jupiter.

Jones had called a friend for help, who came by then left, and let his brother know where he was, before deciding to wait alone in his car for a tow truck. During the wait, Raja, on burglary detail, pulled up in a white, unmarked van, and was out of uniform and without a badge.

A confrontation took place and Jones was shot dead. He was struck three times, once in each arm, and in the side, a shot that entered his aorta.

""We believe that was the fatal shot,"" said Adner Marcelin, a spokeman for Crump's law firm.

Jones’ body was found between 80 and 100 feet from his car. Police said they recovered a gun that Raja claimed Jones pointed at him, in the grass between Jones’ body and his car. The weapon had not been fired. Inside the Hyundai was the box it had been purchased in three days earlier and the paperwork for the purchase.

Raja, a Palm Beach Gardens cop since April, previously worked for the city of Atlantis Police Department. His union representative said the officer fired at Jones because he feared for his safety. Raja has been placed on administrative leave until the investigation plays out.

The shooting, on the heels of several other high-profile shooting deaths of black men during the past 18 months, galvanized the community and garnered national attention. On Thursday a rally was held in Palm Beach Gardens in Jones’ honor. About 1,500 people attended. A town hall meeting is scheduled for Friday night at the Tabernacle Mission Baptist Church in West Palm Beach.

 Save for later
A Florida police officer has been charged with manslaughter and attempted murder for fatally shooting a man who was waiting beside a road for a breakdown truck, and then continuing to fire even as the man ran away in fear.

Nouman Raja was indicted by a Palm Beach County grand jury on Wednesday and arrested for repeatedly shooting Corey Jones, a 31-year-old church band drummer, in the early hours of 18 October last year. Raja could face life in prison if convicted.

Raja was dressed entirely in plainclothes and failed to identify himself as a police officer as he confronted Jones with a gun, according to a charging document released by authorities. He drove the wrong way up an exit ramp in an unmarked van to make contact with Jones, who produced his legally owned handgun before “fleeing, frightened” and throwing the weapon aside.

“The grand jury today has found that Mr Raja’s use of force was unjustified,” state prosecutor Dave Aronberg said at a press conference on Wednesday.

The charging document said Jones’s homicide was caused by “Officer Raja’s culpably negligent actions”. It said Raja approached Jones in a “tactically unsound, unsafe and grossly negligent manner” and that “a reasonable person can only assume the thoughts and concerns Corey Jones was experiencing as he saw the van approaching him at that hour of the morning”.

Jones’s family said in a statement they were relieved that Raja had been charged for what they called a “reckless act”. They said: “While we understand that nothing can bring back our son, brother and friend, this arrest will send a message that this conduct will not be tolerated from members of law enforcement.”

The charges against Raja were based on an extraordinary recording of the shooting captured by a call center that Jones had contacted, requesting roadside assistance after his vehicle broke down on the way back from a concert he played in Jupiter with his band, Future Prezidents. Parts of the recording were transcribed in the charging document, a probable cause affidavit.

After two minutes of chatter, the recording picked up the sound of chimes indicating Jones’s car door was opened, followed by an exchange between him and Raja at about 3.15am. When asked by Raja “You good?”, Jones said: “I’m good.”

Raja asked again: “Really?” Jones replied: “Yeah, I’m good.”

Raja again asked: “Really?” Jones said: “Yeah.” The charging document said: “At no time during the recording did Raja say he was a police officer.”

Raja, who was on duty seeking car burglars but wearing sneakers, blue jeans, a tan T-shirt and a tan-colored Caterpillar-brand baseball cap with a CAT logo, was then heard shouting: “Get your fucking hands up! Get your fucking hands up!”

Jones replied: “Hold on!”

Raja again shouted: “Get your fucking hands up! Drop!”

Immediately after saying “drop”, Raja fired three gunshots, paused for 10 seconds and then fired three more times, according to the recording. Two shots struck Jones in the arms – one from behind as he fled – and one, fatally, hit his chest and passed through his heart.

Raja had left his police vest and service weapon in his vehicle and shot Jones with his personal pistol. His sergeant told investigators Raja had been trained to wear the vest and identify himself as an officer. Having been hired in April 2015, Raja was terminated from his job less than a month after the shooting on the grounds that he did not complete his probation period.

Raja called 911 using his cellphone and reported he had shot a black man carrying a silver handgun before losing contact with him. He claimed that Jones “pointed the gun at me, and started running”. Investigators said they found Jones’s handgun about 72 feet from the back of his car and located Jones’s body about 192 feet away from the car. Jones had bought the Jimenez gun legally just three days earlier at a licensed outlet.

Authorities concluded that Jones fled Raja, tossing his gun in the process, after their verbal exchange. “There is no question that Jones ran away from Raja,” the probable cause affidavit said. “Despite this observation, realizing that Jones had ‘thrown’ his handgun in the grass near the rear of Jones’ vehicle, Officer Raja continued to fire at Jones as he ran away.”

Aronberg, the prosecutor, said on Wednesday that Raja had been charged with one count of manslaughter by culpable negligence, which is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, along with one count of attempted first degree murder, which is punishable by up to life in prison.",Yes,No,,Yes,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e015adb6b0fe33dea2a8f3df29e69e8c4d9e2809/0_80_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=c79252bb2a240536b288303b62d3f6e0,NONE,3:15 AM,Outdoors,Street/Road,,Street stop,,None of the above,,None of the above,,No,No,No,No,"Run away from police,Disobey or ignore police orders",,Issue verbal commands,,Pointed gun at officer,,,,Exact number given.

A State Police trooper fatally shot a man on a footbridge over Storrow Drive near Boston University on Friday afternoon after the man allegedly refused to drop a knife and made threats, unnerving passersby in the well-traveled area, officials and witnesses said.

The confrontation — witnessed by several pedestrians and by motorists including Boston’s former police commissioner — began shortly after 2 p.m., when BU police officers on the Esplanade spotted a man who matched the description of a suspect with outstanding warrants out of Roxbury District Court, State Police Colonel Timothy Alben said.

Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley’s office, which is investigating the shooting according to standard protocol, identified the man Friday night as Santos Laboy, 45, of Somerville.

Laboy fled when police approached him, Alben said, at one point running onto busy Storrow Drive, which borders the Esplanade and the Charles River, then running back into the park.

“It appears he brandished a knife” during the pursuit, Alben said, and was “waving it about.”

Scenes from shooting on Silber footbridge
A knife-wielding man was fatally shot Friday afternoon in a confrontation with a state trooper on a footbridge over Storrow Drive near Boston University Friday afternoon, State Police Colonel Timothy Alben said.
 A recap of fatal shootings by Mass. police officers this year

Laboy ran up onto the footbridge, where he encountered the uniformed state trooper, who had been working a nearby detail and came to assist, officials said.

Laboy and the trooper exchanged words on the bridge, Alben said, and the trooper ordered him to drop the knife, but he refused and made “threatening gestures.”

“There were shots fired at that point,” Alben said.

A distraught woman who answered the phone Friday night at a Boston address listed for Laboy’s mother said, “yes, my brother was killed” and added that she believed he had a small knife with him. She declined to comment further.

Former Boston police commissioner Edward F. Davis said in a telephone interview that he was driving on Storrow Drive on Friday afternoon and witnessed the pursuit of Laboy and the fatal shooting.

Laboy “ran up the walkway and the officers were telling him to ‘Drop the knife! Drop the knife!’ He didn’t drop the knife,” said Davis, who is a security consultant for the Globe.

“Then there was a trooper who had come from the other side of the walkway,” Davis said. “The guy went at him. The trooper said, ‘Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!’ The trooper then fired at him when he refused to drop the weapon.”

Laboy was pronounced dead at the scene after police and paramedics attempted to revive him but were unable to do so, State Police said.

Alben declined to say what words were exchanged between Laboy and the trooper. Jake Wark, a spokesman for Conley, confirmed that Laboy was the man with the warrants out of Roxbury District Court. Alben, who had described the suspect as possibly white or Hispanic, said the warrants were for charges including harassment and annoying a person of the opposite sex.

Laboy has “a substantial and long criminal history, primarily here in Suffolk County,” Alben said.

He declined to say how many shots the trooper fired or where Laboy was struck.

David Procopio, a State Police spokesman, said investigators recovered the knife that Laboy allegedly wielded, but he could not say how large it was.

Laboy frequented the Esplanade, and a Boston police intelligence gathering unit had informed area departments Friday that he was being sought, Alben said.

According to court records, Laboy was convicted in 2010 in Suffolk Superior Court on charges of carrying a dangerous weapon, assault with a dangerous weapon, and malicious destruction of property.

Police investigated the scene where a man was shot by police on the Silber footbridge in Boston.

He was charged as a habitual offender in that case and sentenced to a maximum prison term of five years, court records show. While the case was pending, his lawyer requested funds for a mental health evaluation, according to the case docket.

Jorge Laboy, 47, of Brockton, a cousin of Santos Laboy, said relatives told him that Santos was homeless and had been fired from a job. He said he had been told his cousin had mental health problems after coming out of prison and recently told his sister that “he’s not going back to jail, [and] they’re going to have to kill him.”

Santos Laboy grew up in Boston and his father, who had the same name, owned a liquor store in the city before he died several years ago, Jorge Laboy said.

Laboy had recently posted combative messages on his Facebook page, including one directed at law enforcement officials on June 3 that said, “Despite your threat to use force to capture me if I refuse to surrender, I’m still free and getting stronger by the day. Got nothing to lose.”

On Friday night, relatives offered condolences on Facebook and hinted at his personal struggles.

A woman who identified herself as a cousin wrote that “he needed help in so many ways” and said Santos was “at peace now. I’m so sorry we lost you.”

On Friday, a witness to the shooting, Samantha Bourdeau, 22, said she was riding in a car on Storrow Drive when she saw a man on the road, and “the next thing you knew, you look directly up and he’s on the bridge.” She said she saw police shoot him multiple times and heard at least three consecutive “booms” from the gunfire.

BU graduate student Chelsea Reid said she saw a shirtless man running along the Esplanade and said several officers jumped out of a van and gave chase.

The officers yelled, “Take him down! Take him down!” Reid said. “I’m shaken up. . . . It’s just a lot.”

The shooting came 2½ weeks after Boston police and FBI agents from a Joint Terrorism Task Force shot and killed Usaamah Rahim, 26, of Roslindale, who had allegedly lunged at the investigators with a military-style knife.

Rahim had been under 24-hour surveillance on suspicion of plotting to attack people in the United States in support of the Islamic State

An FBI spokeswoman said the shooting Friday was not related to any terrorism investigation.

Conley said his office will determine whether the use of force was justified based on “a full, fair, and impartial investigation. We draw no conclusions from the preliminary evidence and we reserve judgment until all the facts are in.”

Bourdeau, the witness who saw Laboy make his way from the street to the bridge, said the vehicle she was traveling in was under the bridge during the altercation and that she heard yelling before the gunshots.

“It was so scary,” she said. “When I close my eyes, I still see it.”

Autopsy: Orange County inmate Max Gracia's death ruled a homicide due to police dog bites

Max Gracia's mother didn't blame police Wednesday when autopsy results showed her son died of an infection from police-dog bites.

Instead, Willine Gracia pointed the finger at the Orange County Jail's medical staff, whom she said didn't believe her son when he complained of intense pain.

""He told the nurse, and I want to be specific here, 'I cannot move,'"" Willine Gracia said, recalling what detectives told her during their investigation into Max Gracia's death.

The nurse didn't believe him, the tearful mother told reporters Wednesday.

""My 22-year-old son is now dead,"" she said. ""They killed my son.""

Max Gracia's death and the treatment he received while in custody are under at least two investigations — including one that led to the resignation of a nurse.

Gracia, an armed-robbery suspect, was bitten by a city of Orlando police dog while resisting arrest Aug. 6.

He was bitten multiple times on his left thigh and leg, leading to an infection and his death four days later, the autopsy said.

On the evening of Aug. 8, according to the autopsy, Gracia complained of being unable to get up from his bed to take his medication.

His vital signs were last recorded the morning of Aug. 9, according to the autopsy. At the time, Gracia complained of weakness and dizziness. His heart rate was 131 beats per minute, and his respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute.

According to Chief Medical Examiner Joshua Stephany, a normal resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute, while a normal resting respiratory rate is 16 to 20 breaths per minute.

""For somebody who is not exercising, this can be consistent with an infection,"" Stephany said. Gracia's mother said he had suffered from seizures since he was 17, but the autopsy made no mention of that as a factor in his cause of death.

Gracia was found unresponsive in his jail cell Aug. 10.

A potentially deadly bacteria, E. coli, was found in his lungs and wounds. The autopsy concluded that infection led to septic shock, which can cause multiple organ failure.

""Due to the fact that the death of this individual is a result of injuries sustained during efforts to subdue him as he resisted arrest, the manner of death is homicide,"" the autopsy said.

Homicide is not the same as murder or manslaughter. The ruling means a person was killed, and the designation is used to classify the death for state records.

The source of the bacteria, whether from the lake water or the dog, is unknown.

""Whether the dog had E. coli in its mouth, I don't know,"" Stephany said. ""But the dog bite itself was a root for the bacteria to cause an infection.""

Gracia had codeine and ibuprofen in his system that, Stephany said, were given at the hospital or in the jail.

His system also contained cocaine and marijuana, which Stephany said Gracia took before he was in custody. The autopsy also found morphine, but Stephany said there's no record of it being given as a pain reliever while in custody.

'It's uncalled for'

On Aug. 6, according to police, Gracia used a gun to rob a Circle K on John Young Parkway about 2 a.m.

Officers said Gracia resisted their efforts to take him into custody.

""Gracia struck a K-9 several times and attempted to drown the canine in the lake,"" an Orlando Police Department statement said Wednesday. ""Gracia actively tried to elude officers by hiding in the lake for more than an hour.""

Once in custody, Gracia was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center by paramedics for treatment. Police said he was treated again before being booked into jail later that day.

""OPD had completed an initial review of the incident, and it appears all officers acted within policy and the K-9 performed the job it was trained to do,"" the police statement said. ""The Department is conducting an internal investigation since the K-9 bite is listed as a contributing factor in Gracia's death.""

When Gracia was found unresponsive on the morning of Aug. 10, he was taken to ORMC, where he was pronounced dead.

Orange County Corrections spokeswoman Carrie Proudfit released a statement Wednesday about her department's investigation.

Immediately after Gracia's death, she said, the Corrections Department and the Corrections Health Services Division initiated a review and other investigations surrounding Gracia's care, custody and cause of death.

Since then, one registered nurse has resigned, Proudfit said, and two other health-care professionals — a second registered nurse and an advanced registered nurse practitioner — remain under administrative review.

Proudfit said the results of the review will be released when it's completed.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office also is investigating the death, spokeswoman Jane Watrel said, and a report will go to the State Attorney's Office, which will decide whether to file charges.

Gracia's aunt, Pauline Robinson, said she used to work as a contracted nurse for the jail.

""It's uncalled for to not give a patient their medication regardless of what they've done,"" Robinson said, standing next to Gracia's mother Wednesday. ""She [the nurse] needs to go to jail and lose her nursing license.""

Gracia said she never laid her son to rest because she thought she would need to hire an outside medical examiner to perform an autopsy on her son. Now, after seeing the results of the Orange-Osceola Medical Examiner's Office, she said she can bury her son.

""I want all of those that are to blame for his death, I want charges brought against them,"" Willine Gracia said.

She's also planning to file negligence lawsuits.

""It's not about the money,"" the mother said. ""It's about the way that you treat another human being. Just because a person is incarcerated doesn't make them dirt. It does not decrease the value of life""

An investigation is underway after an Orange County Jail inmate, who got into a fight with an Orlando police K-9 during his arrest, died Monday.

According to officials, 22-year-old Max Gracia was moved from the jail's medical unit to Orlando Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Officials did not detail Gracia's medical condition before his death.

He was arrested Thursday and was facing charges of armed robbery and resisting an officer with violence. Police say Gracia held up a Circle K convenience store at gunpoint and made off with cash from the store's register.

A clerk who was inside the store during the robbery told police that Gracia held the gun at waist level and said ""give me all the money"" then repeatedly said ""I'm sorry but I got to do this"" before taking the money and running away.

No one was injured but the clerk said she was in fear for her life.

Police caught Gracia shortly after the robbery. Investigators say they used a police K-9 to track Gracia but the suspect fought the dog off, according to the arrest report. Police did not say if Gracia was bitten by the dog.

Gracia then ran again, this time into the nearby Lake Mann. He spent about two-hours in the lake before he was finally arrested, officials said.

It's not clear how Gracia, who was housed in the jail's medical ward, died. An autopsy will be conducted to determine what caused his death and if the death was suspicious, jail officials said.

An autopsy performed Wednesday on a man involved in a standoff with police this week shows he died from several gunshots to the torso, according to the Benton County Coroner’s Office.

None of the wounds on Roark K. Cook, 36, appear to be self-inflicted, indicating he died after an exchange of gunfire with Benton County Deputy Logan Brown and Richland police Officer Ryan Miller.

The bullets appear to have struck Cook from the front and side, entering above the thighs and below the shoulders, said Coroner John Hansens. A forensic pathologist is working to determine how many times he was struck.

Toxicology tests to determine if Cook was under the influence will be done and results could take up to eight weeks.

Cook’s mother called 911 early Monday morning saying she was concerned for her son’s safety and that he could harm others, police said. The woman said Cook had access to guns and could be mentally unstable.

Court records show and family members say Cook battled mental-health issues.

Police tracked Cook to the West Ninth Avenue apartment and tried to get a woman to open the door, police said. The officers then heard a commotion inside and tried to knock the door down. Cook reportedly shouted he had a gun and police retreated.

A short while later, a woman and a 7-year-old boy came out onto a second-story balcony, and police helped the child escape, police said. The woman tried to climb down but Cook pulled her back inside.

The woman got free and when she tried to escape over the balcony a second time, Cook fired at least one shot, police said. The officers then returned fire.

Police apparently used their bodies to shield the woman as the gunfire erupted. Kennewick police Sgt. Ken Lattin called the officers heroes during a press conference a few hours after the shooting.

Police helped a second woman inside the apartment escape over the balcony. The women and boy were not injured.

Cook remained armed inside the apartment, refusing to surrender or get medical help, police said. Members of the Richland Bomb Squad blew the door to the apartment off and used a robot to check on Cook, who eventually died.

The Tri-City Special Investigations Unit is looking into the shooting to determine whether it was justified. The deputy and police officer are on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

Cook had a long history of domestic violence in the Tri-Cities against several different women, including one who lived at the apartment where the standoff occurred, court records show.

He has convictions for violating no-contact orders, domestic-violence related assaults, harassment, assault with a sexual motivation, malicious mischief and burglary.

A majority of his convictions and jail and prison sentences stem from domestic violence-related incidents.

Standoff situation in Kennewick
Standoff situation in Kennewick
KENNEWICK, WA. -- A wife is asking why the day after her husband died in a standoff with police.
We are learning a lot about 38-year-old Roark Cook Tuesday afternoon after an intense stand off Monday morning that, according to police, included several hostages and ended with Cook's death. 

Just two hours ago, we met with Roark's wife Ruby Cook and some of Roark's family and friends at Volunteer Park in Pasco. She believes Cook was a good father to his two children, a girl who is 5 and a teenage boy. Ruby told us that Cook said that day, that he wanted the police to kill him. She was talking to him on the phone just minutes before he died.

Looking into Roark Cook's past, he has a long history of criminal behavior dating back to 1999. Some of the charges include third degree rape, assaulting an officer and numerous domestic violence charges with several different women, including Ruby. 

In one case, police even say Cook pushed a bookcase on top of his wife while she held their 1-year-old child in her arms. Ruby and Roark's friends say the criminal history can be explained with Roark's many mental illnesses including severe depression, severe anxiety and possibly bi-polar disorder.

They say Roark was prescribed medication to deal with his problems and they question was really happened that day. 

""There was no standoff, he was not shooting at cops, he was not shooting at anybody,"" Ruby Cook said. ""He was trying to hurt himself.""

""He was in a constant struggle,"" Jessica Orozco said. ""I mean his struggles with mental illness had him in and out of Benton County and Franklin County over these last 8-years and even some prison time. But he never stopped trying to be better. He never stopped trying to conquer his illness.""

Tuesday morning, officers were rapping up the investigation at the scene of the standoff in Kennewick. We talked to the Benton County Coroner on the phone Tuesday afternoon.

He says medical attention was given to Roark at the scene after police finally breached the apartment. The medical providers even had to wear gas masks because of the intense amount of smoke left over from the flash bang grenades.     

On Wednesday, a final autopsy will be preformed on Roark's body. We'll bring you that information as soon as we get it. 

At the end of our interview, Ruby Cook made us promise to mention the Go Fund Me account they have set up to help pay for the funeral costs for Roark Cook that they say they cannot afford.

A Benton County sheriff’s deputy and Richland police officer were justified last May in killing a 36-year-old man during a hostage situation, according to Benton County’s prosecutor, though one of the hostages told the deputy during the standoff the gun was fake.

Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller provided his review of the special investigation of the shooting of Roark Cook to the Herald on Wednesday afternoon. He said Deputy Logan Brown and Officer Ryan Miller acted appropriately in the May 4 shooting of Cook.

The law enforcement officers, who were initially placed on paid administrative leave following the shooting and pending the special investigation, returned to regular duty weeks ago, officials said.

All shots fired during the standoff came from law enforcement, despite initial reports that Cook fired at officers.

A spray-painted replica gun was the only thing resembling a firearm found near Cook’s body after the shooting. No other guns were found in the Kennewick apartment where the standoff happened.

But Cook’s assertion he had a gun and would shoot when officers first tried to enter the apartment, the resemblance of the replica gun to the real thing and the threatening way he brandished it when one of the hostages tried to climb down a balcony to escape, gave Brown and Ryan Miller good reason to use their own weapons, the prosecutor said.

“I don’t think the officers had a choice,” Andy Miller told the Herald.

Police went to Cook’s apartment at 3320 W. Ninth Ave. early on May 4 after his mother called 911 concerned he may hurt himself and said he had access to guns. Cook had mental health issues and a history of violence against women in the Tri-Cities, including allegations of abuse by a woman who also lived at the apartment, said the review.

Richland police, sheriff’s deputies and the Tri-City SWAT team were called in as backup after Cook said he had a gun and barricaded the apartment door.

Shortly after, a woman handed a 7-year-old boy from the apartment balcony to officers waiting below before Cook pulled her back inside. It was then Brown heard the woman say Cook had a toy gun.

When the woman got back onto the balcony minutes later and began climbing down, Cook came out and pointed what appeared to be a gun at her and the officers helping her down. That’s when Brown and Ryan Miller fired several shots at him before retreating to the apartment. A second woman then came out and climbed down the balcony to officers.

When Cook refused to surrender, the Richland Bomb Squad blew open the door and used a robot to check on him. He died a short while later.

A coroner’s report found Cook died as a result of several gunshot wounds to his torso, and none appeared to be self-inflicted. Toxicology results were not immediately available Wednesday.

The investigation found Ryan Miller was not aware of the woman’s statement that Cook didn’t have a working gun, but also that he didn’t clearly see Cook brandish the replica weapon. The officer fired his weapon after seeing Cook force one woman back into the apartment and the sound of Brown’s gunshots.

While Brown heard a hostage say Cook’s weapon was fake, like Ryan Miller he’d heard about the initial call to 911 and Cook’s statement that he had a gun. The appearance of the weapon when Cook pointed it at the woman and officers gave him good reason to think it was a threat, Andy Miller wrote.

“It looked like a real gun,” Andy Miller told the Herald.

“It’s a bad situation,” he said, adding he feels terrible for Cook’s family. “(Cook) was in a difficult time in his life, he may have been a good man, but he made some bad decisions that day.”

The man who died early Wednesday shortly after being arrested by Spokane police was identified Thursday as Lorenzo Hayes, 37.

Hayes died after an unspecified medical emergency as Spokane County Jail officers were trying to restrain him in the booking area, police said Wednesday. Officers said he became uncooperative during the ride to jail.

The cause of death is pending toxicology reports and further investigation.

County Commissioner Todd Mielke said Wednesday he was told Hayes suffered a cardiac incident during booking.


Police were called to the 5400 block of North Addison Street before 6 a.m. Wednesday for domestic violence. A witness told police he saw the man involved take a rifle from his Jeep Cherokee and hide it near the house.

Hayes was outside the home when police arrived even though a protection order was in place forbidding him from having contact with the woman who lives there. Police recovered a .22-caliber rifle outside the home.

Hayes was arrested on suspicion of violating a no-contact order and unlawful possession of a firearm. Officers noticed that he was sweating profusely and appeared to be high. When asked, Hayes told police that he “drank something,” according to court documents.

The Spokane Regional Safe Streets Task Force had previously identified Hayes as a “midlevel” methamphetamine and heroin dealer.",No,,,,,,http://www.krem.com/404,BROKEN,BROKEN,No,No,,No,,BROKEN,Yes,http://www.kxly.com/news/spokane-news/prosecutor-officers-not-criminally-responsible-in-lorenzo-hayes-death/37381706,Prosecutor: Officers not criminally responsible in Lorenzo Hayes' death,"Prosecutor: Officers not criminally responsible in Lorenzo Hayes' death

Spokane County Jail
Prisoner dies after struggle with Spokane jail guards
SPOKANE, Wash. -
The Spokane County Prosecutor's Office has ruled law enforcement officers are not criminally responsible for the death of a man taken into custody last May.

Lorenzo Hayes died after he was taken to the Spokane County Jail for violating a no contact order with his girlfriend on May 13. During the trip to the jail, Spokane police officers noted he was behaving erratically and sweating profusely, which the prosecutor's office reported was consistent with drug use, adding that officers who had contacted Hayes previously agreed his behavior was inconsistent with previous contacts with him.

Hayes continued to waver between being calm to extremely agitated, authorities called for medics but they were canceled when Hayes calmed down and showed no signs of being under duress.

En route to the jail, while sitting in the back of a patrol car, Hayes was calm but then became agitated, banging his head against the sides of the patrol car.

Once he arrived at the jail he became uncooperative and struggled with deputies. Medical staff were called into assist as he was placed unrestrained in a restraint chair. Before a nurse could evaluate him, Hayes became unresponsive, was placed on the floor, and CPR was started. AMR and the Spokane Fire Department were called in to assist and Hayes was transported to Sacred Heart Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

The Spokane County Medical Examiner's Office later reported Hayes, 27, was high on methamphetamine and inhaled vomit while in custody in the jail.

SAN BERNARDINO >> A man allegedly holding a woman at knifepoint in front of his two children was shot and killed by a San Bernardino police officer late Saturday morning.

The unidentified 49-year-old man was taken to a hospital where he later died, said Sgt. Vicki Cervantes.

The man, allegedly armed with the knife, had reportedly gotten into an argument with a neighbor just before 11:30 a.m. in the 500 block of Tia Juana Street, she said. The neighbor managed to flag down an officer and told the officer the knife-wielding man had run into a nearby home where two women and the man’s children were staying, officials said.

• Video: Police investigate a fatal officer-involved shooting in San Bernardino

“As (the officer) was walking toward the front door he had a clear visual of the suspect,” Cervantes said. “That suspect was holding a female in the residence with a knife in a threatening manner.”

“He was yielding the knife, waving it around, yelling something to the effect of ‘Shoot me! Shoot me!’” she said.

After the woman managed to free herself from her attacker, the officer shot the man after he allegedly continued to wave the knife around and refused to comply with the officer’s commands. No one else was hurt in the shooting.

Neighbor, Manuel Sanchez, identified the dead man only as Roy, adding that the home where the shooting took place was Roy’s mother-in-law’s house.

“That’s really sad,” said Sanchez who heard about four or five shots from his home.

It was not immediately clear if Roy was holding and threatening his wife or mother-in-law.

Cervantes said it was unclear what sparked the initial argument, but did say that the 49-year-old had used the knife to stab at the vehicle of the man who flagged down the officer.

Homicide detectives are investigating the incident.

A man who was holding a large knife up to a woman in a “threatening manner” was fatally shot by police at a San Bernardino home on Saturday, according to the San Bernardino Police Department.

An officer was flagged down by a person regarding a dispute with a neighbor in the 500 block of Tia Juana Street North around 11:30 a.m., Sgt. Vicki Cervantes said.

The person said their vehicle had been stabbed by a man — who was later identified as being 49 — before he retreating into a home, a police news release stated.

The officer approached the residence and found the man holding a woman, and a knife in the other hand.

The knife was held “against the female in a threatening manner,” police stated.

Another woman and two juveniles of unknown ages were also seen in the home.

The officer repeatedly told the man to drop the knife, but police said he did not comply.

“The female attempted to move away from the suspect, who was obviously in an agitated state as the suspect, who was wielding the knife, shouted something to the effect of ‘shoot me,'” police stated.

The officer then fired several rounds at the man, who was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The investigation was ongoing and anyone with additional information was asked to contact Detective Flesher at 909-384-5655 or Sgt.

SOUTH EL MONTE >> A South El Monte man who killed his neighbor with a meat cleaver and wounded the man’s wife Tuesday “had some sort of delusional belief” that the couple was stealing his Wi-Fi connection, an investigator said Wednesday.

Lt. Victor Lewandowski of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau said 32-year-old Thong Kien Ma also had not slept for three days and that detectives are waiting for the autopsy results to see if there are any drugs in Ma’s system.

Deputies shot and killed Ma after he refused orders to drop the meat cleaver and charged toward them.

Lewandowski said he thinks the two families were neighbors in the 10400 block of Enloe Street for a long time.

Ed Winter, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner, identified the neighbor killed as 59-year-old Chau Da Ngo. Autopsies are pending for Ngo and Ma, he said.

Sheriff’s officials haven’t identified Ngo’s wife. Lewandowski said the woman suffered several lacerations to her head and shoulders that required stitches. He didn’t know if she’s still at the hospital.

No one answered the door at Ma’s home Wednesday. A paper plate with an orange, apple, Asian pear and a kiwi lay on the sidewalk in front of the house. A plate of fruit was also in an altar by the front door and a makeshift altar in the yard.

There were five vehicles parked in the Ngos’ residence Wednesday. A young woman came to the gate and said: “I’m not interested in saying anything.”

Lt. Tom McNeal of the sheriff’s Temple station said deputies had not responded to either house before.

Lewandowski wasn’t sure if Tuesday’s attack started at one house or if Ma came over to the neighbors. A deputy responding to a call of a stabbing found Ngo’s wounded wife. Paramedics took her to a hospital.

The deputy saw Ma standing in a flower bed hacking at something, moved closer and realized he was attacking Ngo, according to Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez.

The deputy told Ma to drop the weapon. He raised the meat cleaver and charged at the deputy who shot him, Navarro-Suarez said.

A second deputy arrived. Ma refused to drop the meat cleaver and moved toward the deputies. He was shot again.

Both Ma and Ngo died at the scene.

Miguel Enriquez who lives on Enloe Street didn’t know Ma or the Ngos. He was shocked when he found out about the fatal attack.

“You never see this kind of thing, especially here,” Enriquez said.

""It takes an extreme set of circumstances for a Los Angeles Police officer to become involved in a shooting with an unarmed individual,"" Beck said at a press conference Wednesday. ""At this point in the investigation, we don’t see those circumstances.”

The man, who was suspected of harassing passersby near the boardwalk, was approached by two LAPD officers late Tuesday night.

After police spoke with the suspect, he walked away towards the boardwalk, and the officers walked back to their patrol vehicle, according to an LAPD statement.

Soon thereafter, the officers saw the man fighting with a bar bouncer on the sidewalk and returned to talk to him. A struggle ensued, during which ""an Officer Involved Shooting (OIS) occurred,"" police said in a statement.

Paramedics administered CPR on the man and transported him to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

The man was unarmed, police said. He was identified by the L.A. County Coroner only as being in his 20s.

Chief Beck said that investigators had not interviewed the officer involved in the shooting, who is on pain medication for a knee injury sustained during the altercation.

Beck said he had viewed surveillance video of the incident that shows the altercation described by the officers.

""We will expend all resources to find out the truth of what happened last night on Windward Avenue,'' Beck said. ""We will get to the bottom of this.""

A town hall meeting will be held with LAPD officials and inspector general at the Westminster Avenue Elementary School on Abbot Kinney Boulevard at 6 p.m. Thursday.

Multiple police shootings

The officer-involved shooting in Venice was one of several reported in the Los Angeles area on Tuesday. One incident resulted in a suspect being hospitalized in critical condition and another ended in a fatality.

SOUTH LA

At around the same time as the Venice incident, an LAPD officer shot a Hispanic man in his early to mid-20s. The man had pointed a gun at police in South L.A., according to Sgt. Frank Preciado.

Officers with the elite Metropolitan Division were attempting to stop the man when he ran about 100 feet and disappeared between two buildings in the 5800 block of Broadway Boulevard, said Preciado.

“The officer looks up and now the suspect is on the rooftop of a second story building pointing his firearm at the officer,” he said. The officer opened fire.



After the LAPD set up a perimeter around the building, the man ""came out with his hands up. He had been hit in the torso,"" said Preciado.

The man is in critical but stable condition at the hospital, Preciado said.

“The officers recovered a handgun at the rear of the building.”

Neither the man nor the officer has been identified.

The department has increased patrols in crime “hot spots” using Metro officers, part of LAPD's response to a recent spike in crime, Preciado said.

He said the officer who opened fire was not one of the 200 new Metro cops added to the department under a plan unveiled by Mayor Eric Garcetti last month.

Those officers will start hitting the streets later this month, Preciado said.

SOUTH EL MONTE

In South El Monte, a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a man who was attacking a man with a meat cleaver Tuesday, according to the department.

L.A. Sheriff's Deputies were responding to calls of an assault with a deadly weapon Tuesday afternoon when they came upon a woman bleeding from the head in the 10400 block of Enloe Street.



“The deputy’s attention was then directed to the suspect who was standing in a flower bed outside the front door to the residence … and realized the suspect was hacking a male with a meat cleaver,” according to a statement from the Sheriff's Dept.

“The suspect then raised the meat cleaver and charged at the deputy,” before he was shot, the statement said.  He then charged at deputies a second time and was shot again. 

He was pronounced dead at the scene. The man he was hacking also died.

It appears that the suspect was a neighbor of the victims, who are husband and wife. Neither of the victims, nor the alleged assailant, has yet been identified.

PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN 6) – A man was shot and killed on the west side of the Winco Foods building in Northeast Portland by patrol officers late Sunday night.

The two officers from the East Precinct, Dominic Lovato and Michael Currier, made contact with 3 people standing at the trunk of a car in the parking lot of Winco Foods.

Officials said Lovato and Currier talked with the group for a few minutes when one of them, Alan Lee Bellew, got a handgun from the car and pointed it at the officers and the other 2 people.

Both officers fired at Bellew, who fell into the passenger seat of the car. They immediately put out a “shots fired” call and 2 minutes later called for medical help.

Medical responders arrived and, 4 minutes after being called, they determined Bellew was dead.

The two other people who were standing with Bellew, a man and a woman, were questioned as witnesses. Their identities have not been revealed.

The gun Bellew waved at the officers and the witnesses turned out to be a starter pistol, officials said.

The 29-year-old from the Eugene/Springfield area was wanted in Lane County for a felony failure to appear on a heroin charge. He was also wanted for a probation violation for resisting arrest and 4th-degree assault.

The medical examiner said Bellew died from the gunshot wounds, but toxicology results may take weeks.

Lovato and Currier were placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard practice in such cases.

Police reaction

“Use of force, any type of force, but especially the use of deadly force is the most traumatic incident that officers go through in their career,” said Daryl Turner, the president of the Portland Police Association. “It’s something that no matter how long you’re a police officer or no matter how long you live, you carry that with you for the rest of your life so it’s not taken lightly.”

Turner did not discuss specifics of this case.

“What people have to understand is when anyone, any one citizen, decides that they’re going to use deadly force on an officer, that’s shocking to me.”

He said if a suspect is willing to use deadly force against an officer they “will use it against every other citizen – man, woman, child — no matter who they are.”

PORTLAND, OR (KPTV) -
An investigation is underway after a man was shot and killed in an officer-involved shooting in the parking lot of a WinCo grocery store.

A spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau said two officers came into contact with the suspect at a car in the parking lot at the corner of Northeast 122nd Avenue and San Rafael Street around 11:30 p.m. Sunday.

It wasn't clear what led to the shooting, but police said shots were fired and the suspect was injured. It wasn't immediately clear if one or both officers fired their guns.

Additional officers responded to the scene and police started providing medical care to the suspect while they waited for medical personnel to arrive.

When they arrived, medical personnel determined the suspect was dead.

Police said a gun was recovered as part of their investigation of the incident.

A man and a woman who were not injured in the shooting were detained at the scene.

Police said they expected to release more information sometime Monday afternoon.

The officer or officers involved are on paid administrative leave while the incident is under investigation. When detectives finish their investigation, the case will go to the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office, which will present the case to a grand jury.

PORTLAND POLICE BUREAU - Alan Lee Bellew

A Multnomah County grand jury ruled Monday that two Portland police officers were justified in using deadly force against Alan Lee Bellew, 29, on June 28.

Bellew died after being shot by officer when he pointed a start pistol at them during a late night encounter.

Neither officer was injured. They are Dominic Lovato, an eight-year veteran of the Portland Police Bureau, and Michael Currier, a seven-year bureau veteran.

According to the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office, the grand jury determined that the use of deadly force against Mr. Bellew was justified under the criminal law. A motion to publicly disclose the transcripts of grand jury testimony will be presented later this month to the Presiding Court. If the motion is granted, the grand jury transcripts will be available on the District Attorney’s website at http://www.mcda.us/.

Officer Involved Shooting

Phoenix Police have identified Adam O'Neal Reinhart, 29, as the man fatally shot by officers after he reportedly pulled a weapon on them Saturday, according to a department statement.

Police confronted Reinhart, who ignored police commands before he pulled a handgun from his waistband, prompting an officer to fire a single round from a service rifle into Reinhart, according to Sgt. Vince Lewis, a Phoenix Police spokesman.

The officer's name had not been released as of Monday afternoon.

Police had gone to the area of 18th Street and Palm Lane on Saturday afternoon after receiving multiple 911 calls of a man acting strangely and in danger of being struck by traffic, according to a police department statement.

Witness statements varied, with some stating that Reinhart produced a weapon and others saying that he had not. Neighbors told reporters that Reinhart was often seen in the area and they believed him to be homeless.

After being shot, Reinhart was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Lewis said.

The officer who fired the fatal round is a 10-year veteran of the force and is on paid, administrative leave while the investigation is underway, per Phoenix Police policy, Lewis said.

Gibraltar police officers will not face charges in the death of an assault suspect last spring after a Taser was used during his arrest, the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office said Tuesday.

David Kapuscinski, 39, died about an hour after the confrontation with police early April 16, county officials said.

Police were dispatched to an apartment in the 14600 block of Middle Gibraltar Road around 3:20 a.m. when a 12-year-old called 911 “regarding his mother being assaulted by her boyfriend,” the prosecutor’s office said.

In a statement at the time, the police department said responding officers found a man who was “out of control and assaulting the caller’s mother.”

The prosecutor’s office said Tuesday that the two officers went to a bedroom and saw Kapuscinski “in the nude, sexually assaulting the children’s mother and repeatedly yelling that he was going to kill the woman.”

The officers ordered him off the woman, but Kapuscinski refused and “became combative” when they tried to arrest him, the prosecutor’s office said.

“One of the officers deployed his Taser and it separated Kapuscinski from the woman. The suspect continued kicking and was combative with the officers,” the statement read. “As a result, he was Tased three times by the officers to stop him from (fighting the officers) and resisting arrest. He collapsed from the Tasing.”

Police initially said Kapuscinski then “began to show signs of medical complications.” The prosecutor’s office said he received emergency medical treatment and a medical examiner determined the man “eventually died as a result of cardiac (dysrhythmia).” A toxicology report also found “3000 (milligrams) of amphetamine in his blood system.”

Gibraltar police in April said the officer involved was placed on administrative leave and a preliminary investigation showed “all department policies and procedures in this incident were followed and the officer’s use of force was justified.”

The prosecutor’s office agreed Tuesday, saying the officers “used reasonable force in deploying their Tasers” to arrest Kapuscinski.

“All the evidence that we reviewed showed that the responding officers acted just as officers should act when there are very frightened children, an out of control man with a large amount of drugs sexually assaulting and threatening to kill the children’s mother, who then turned his wrath on the officers,” Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said.

Gibraltar police say they gave David Kapuscinski an order and he would not comply.

Officers say he was attacking his girlfriend in front of them but she says that is not the whole story. 

She says a video of Kapuscinski having an outburst at American Jewelry and Loan on ""Hardcore Pawn"" was not all that it seems.

""The male subject failed to comply with verbal orders,"" said Police Chief Larry Williams. ""He was tasered."" 

Williams says officers arrived at the Gibraltar Shore Apartments in response to a 911 call only to find David Kapuscinski assaulting his girlfriend. 

The incident happened at about 3:30 a.m. Thursday morning.

FOX 2 spoke with the woman police say Kapuscinski was attacking.

At about 3:30 a.m. Thursday the Gibraltar Police were forced to use a taser to subdue a man they described as “out of control.” The man was pronounced dead at a local hospital later in the morning.

According to a release from the Michigan State Police the officers were responding to a domestic assault complaint at the Gibraltar Shores Apartments, 14680 Gibraltar Road.

The MSP release said officers were forced to use the electric shock device to subdue the man. During the arrest he became unresponsive. Details are not being released.

Gibraltar Police Chief Larry Williams released a prepared statement about the incident and said no further comment would come from the department.
“Officers arrived on the scene and confronted the subject that was in the act of assaulting the victim,” he said. “While attempting to take the suspect into custody the officers deployed a taser. The suspect began to show signs of medical complication. Rescue was called and the suspect was transported to the hospital.”

The officer’s name and rank were not released.

“Preliminary investigation show that all department policies and procedures in this incident were followed and justified. At this time the Gibraltar officer who was involved has been placed on administrative leave and the investigation has been turned over to the Michigan State Police.”

The man’s name and age are being held pending an autopsy.

After roughly 3 hours a barricaded gunman situation was over, a suspect dead and a police officer shot as a result of the tragic incident.

The day started with the suspect, 25-year-old Caso Jackson opening fire on a house early Saturday. Kelvin Warren and his wife were inside the house when Jackson opened fire. ""He's been threatening us for the last 3 weeks and he told my wife i'm gonna save a place in hell for you.""

Warren's wife of 40 plus years is recovering in the hospital from glass shards to her chest after he says Jackson came to their Freeland Street home and shot twice through their bedroom window. 

Utica Warren, Jackson's sister says ""we came over here and he was already in the house waving it at everybody. I guess he couldn't take the fact that she was leaving him."" Family member say the two had been experiencing marital issues recently. 

We're told Jackson then went to his wife's home on nearby Strathmoor on Detroit's west side and took her and four others hostage.

A 23-year-old, their one-year-old, a one-month-old baby and a 15-year-old.

Amon Warren is that 15-year-old. Warren describes what Jackson was saying to him during the standoff. ""He just said say good bye to your momma and take care of your little sister and that was it""

Jackson eventually released all the hostages except his wife Malikh who recently filed a personal protection order against him. 

Negotiators thought the stand-off was close to ending when Jackson came out. But Jackson then made a decision that would cost him his life. He proceeded to climb on top of an armored vehicle and opened fire.

Detroit Police chief James Craig said Jackson literally jumped off the front porch in possession of a shot gun started firing north of the residence where swat officers were deployed.

A Detroit police officer was hit in the face during the shooting, his helmet likely saving his life. 

Jackson died as a result of the gun fire. 

Malikh who remained inside the home when the bullets started flying made it out scared but safe. Those who know them are grateful more people weren't hurt or killed.

Police say the investigation is far from over. They will now focus on interviewing those involved and collecting evidence from the scene.

DETROIT - The hostage situation that developed on Detroit's west side Saturday morning came to a close with one officer injured and the gunman killed, according to Detroit police.

The situation began around 7:30 a.m. on the 13300 block of Strathmoor Street where Caso Jackson, 25, barricaded himself in a home and held hostages.

An exchange of fire occurred between police and Jackson when he jumped from the home's front porch with a shotgun firing at officers.

""Tragic outcome today,"" said Police Chief James Craig. ""One of our SWAT officers received a gunshot wound as a result of the standoff.""

Chief Craig said that the officer was shot in the face and was transported to the hospital but that it looks like the officer will be OK.

All of the hostages were released unharmed.

Jackson was pronounced dead at the hospital.

It all started early Saturday morning when Jackson went to his mother-in-law's home at Freeland Street and Grand River Avenue looking for his wife, Malikh Jackson. Shots were fired at the home and the mother-in-law was hit by flying glass and taken to the hospital.

""I heard the first shot, so I immediately grabbed her and we both fell on the floor,"" said Kelvin Warren Sr., Malikh's father. ""He'd been threatening us for the past three weeks. He told my wife, 'I'm going to save a place in hell for you'.""

Jackson then went to his wife's home on Strathmoor Street where he took her and four other family members hostage, including two children.

""He busted through the window and then he had us hostage in the room,"" said Amon Warren, 15, hostage and son of Malikh. ""He just said, 'Say goodbye to your mama', and to take care of my little sister.""

Police said the gunman had at least two guns and that he was pointing them at officers from inside the home.

Chief Craig said that he thought negotiations were going well and that the gunman had agreed to come out of the home and surrender.

Instead the man jumped off the front porch wearing an army fatigue jacket and firing a shotgun at officers.

Officers fired back at the suspect and he was transported to the hospital where he died.

""We're just glad she's okay and the kids are safe,"" said Tyana Stokes, a family friend. ""He was harassing other people in her family and stuff like that.""

Police said it appears to have stemmed from a domestic issue and that the wife has a personal protection order against her husband.

A harrowing, violent night for a southcentral Salt Lake City neighborhood ended with police fatally shooting a wanted parolee after he allegedly broke into two homes, threatening a toddler's safety in one and stabbing a woman in another.

Public safety dispatchers say police approached the suspect about 12:09 a.m. Wednesday at 850 S. Roberta St. (250 East), a duplex where a 28-year-old female resident had been stabbed in the abdomen. Police found the assailant inside the unit, a confrontation ensued and an officer shot and killed the man.

No officer injuries were reported.

Police identified the decedent as Robert Richard Berger, a 48-year-old Salt Lake City man with a long criminal history ranging from aggravated robbery and aggravated kidnapping convictions to burglary, vehicle theft, drug and numerous fleeing police violations.

The deadly denouement came just minutes after Berger allegedly had attempted to break into a 2-year-old girl's bedroom through the window of an apartment at 838 S. Roberta St.; he was chased off by the child's parents, who called 911.

William Piper, the parents' upstairs neighbor, said the girl's father tried to use a hammer to fight the suspect through the kitchen window.

""It happened so quick. I don't know where [the intruder] came from,"" Piper said. ""I guess by the time [my neighbor] got him out, I guess he ran [to the duplex] and just started stabbing the girl.""

The woman's screaming had awakened Piper. As police were responding to the parents' call, dispatchers received the call about the woman being assaulted at the nearby duplex.

""It was kind of scary. … It just kept getting louder — her yelling, as she's getting stabbed,"" Piper said.

Piper came outside to see his downstairs neighbor coming outside, which is when they saw officers responding to the scene, and ""the lady was still screaming,"" Piper said.

An officer shot Berger at the women's duplex, Piper added.

The woman who was stabbed was taken to the hospital in serious condition, but her injuries were not considered life-threatening, SLCPD Detective Richard Chipping said.

Sandy Patterson, the neighbor of the woman who was stabbed, told The Tribune that the victim and her younger sister had moved into the duplex about a week ago.

Patterson said she fell asleep last night while watching television.

She said she awoke to the sound of ""pounding on her door and screaming for help.""

Patterson said the younger sister told her that someone was stabbing her older sister.

Patterson said she tried to call 911 but was unable to get through.

Minutes later, she said, she heard a single gunshot.

""It happened quickly, as far as I know,"" Patterson said.

Police were at the scene overnight and investigated as dawn broke.

The officer who fired the fatal shot was on administrative leave, pending an independent review of the shooting by the Unified Police Department.

Utah Department of Corrections spokeswoman Brooke Adams said Berger had served nearly 14 years in prison prior to being paroled in June 2014, but he had returned to state custody several times since for parole violations.

Berger recently had been released to the Fortitude Treatment Center ""to stabilize as he transitioned to the community,"" Adams said in a statement.

""[Berger] was last seen at the center on Sunday,"" Adams stated, noting that he checked out for a medical appointment on that day and was due back that evening.

""He failed to return Sunday night, and our agents got a warrant for his arrest on Monday,"" Adams said.

The Fortitude Treatment Center, which opened in Salt Lake City in 2012, allows offenders to stay in the community instead of returning to prison.

While there, offenders are under tight restrictions and undergo intensive treatment programs to address ""underlying issues causing [them] to struggle,"" according to the center's website. Parolees can leave to look for work, go to work, attend school or see family.

Berger's most serious past criminal offense occurred on July 5, 2000.

A Salt Lake County jail inmate at the time, Berger deliberately injured his arm to get a doctor's visit. While getting X-rays in a downtown office, Berger slipped a handcuff and ran out, jumping into an unlocked running car in which a 49-year-old woman was dozing in the backseat.

In an interview two days later with The Tribune, the woman told of riding with Berger as he confided to her about his hatred of prison and his expectation of being killed by police.

She said she had opportunities to escape, such as when Berger entered a convenience store to buy cigarettes, and at the park when he visited the men's restroom. But she said she was too frightened to act.

Berger later pleaded guilty to first-degree felony aggravated robbery and was sentenced to prison for up to life.

(Al Hartmann | The Salt Lake Tribune) Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill holds a press conference Monday October 19 with Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown, middle, to discuss the findings of the Officer Involved Critical Incident (OICI) review and Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder, left, in the Sept. 23 incident involving Salt Lake City Police Department Officer Ben Hone who shot and killed a home intruder as he assaulted Salt Lake City residents and sisters Breann and Kayli Lasley. The review determined the use of deadly force by Hone was legally justified.

A knife blade was plunged into Breann Lasley's abdomen when Salt Lake City police officer Ben Hone ran into her laundry room to find her sitting on the floor and bleeding.

Robert Richard Berger was grasping the handle, his arms and legs wrapped around Lasley from behind to hold her on the floor. As Berger pulled out the knife, his head tipped briefly out from behind Lasley's. Through the dim light filtering in from the rooms upstairs, Hone saw his shot and took it.

Hone's actions, as recounted by Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill and Unified Police investigators, were ""heroic,"" Gill said in a news conference Monday to announce that his office had deemed the fatal shooting on Sept. 23 legally justified.

""I do not use this term lightly,"" Gill said. ""These are the heroic actions of an officer who was well-trained and in the execution of his duties did exactly as he was trained to do.""

Gill joined Salt Lake City police Chief Mike Brown and Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder in extending that praise to 28-year-old Lasley and her younger sister, Kayli, who also was attacked by Berger.

""These two sisters are incredible,"" Gill said.

Breann Lasley was in her bedroom near 800 South and Roberta Street at about 11:45 p.m. Sept. 22, when she thought she heard a man say, ""Hey,"" outside her window, which was partly open, according to a report released by Gill's office and UPD.

Breann Lasley looked out the window of the duplex the sisters had moved into about a week earlier and saw nothing. She was sending a text message to a friend at about midnight when Berger, 48, put a chair next to her window and climbed into her bedroom, saying, ""Hey, girl, I'm coming in.""

Breann Lasley said she tried to push Berger out of the window, but he already was inside the room. Berger hit Breann several times and demanded her car keys, detectives reported.

Kayli Lasley was in the basement when she heard Breann Lasley screaming. She ran upstairs, but Berger kicked her back down the stairs. Breann screamed at Kayli to call police as Breann and Berger fought, moving out of the bedroom and into the kitchen.

Berger pushed Breann Lasley down the stairs and into the duplex basement, investigators wrote. She got ahold of her phone and called 911 but was able to give only the address while she fought.

Kayli Lasley also tried calling 911 when Berger chased after her. Kayli later told investigators that Berger yelled, ""I'm not going to kill you. I'm not going to rape you. Just give me your car keys."" He grabbed Kayli's cellphone and threw it.

Breann Lasley tackled Berger, pushing him into the laundry room, investigators wrote. As they wrestled, Kayli Lasley grabbed the legs of a computer desk and hit Berger with them.

Breann Lasley then screamed: ""He's got a knife! He's got a knife! He's stabbing me! He's stabbing me!"" She told investigators that she told Kayli Lasley to go upstairs.

Berger had stabbed Breann Lasley in the abdomen. She told him he could have anything in the house and offered to give him $1,000 if he would stop stabbing her, investigators reported.

Meanwhile, Kayli Lasley ran outside and screamed for help. A neighbor, Sandy Patterson, told The Tribune that she awoke to Kayli pounding on her door and screaming that her sister was being stabbed. Patterson said she tried to call 911 but couldn't get through.

But she wasn't the only one who heard Kayli Lasley's screams.

Not long before Berger broke into the Lasleys' house, another burglary had been reported at an apartment just two doors away. Berger allegedly had tried to break into a 2-year-old girl's bedroom, but he was chased away by the child's parents. A neighbor of that family told The Tribune that the child's father at one point was using a hammer to fight the suspect through a kitchen window. The parents called 911, and Hone arrived in the neighborhood.",Yes,Yes,http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=a7wkp8iByIon10lyspDAmc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYs3xYzwh4Wo5ICdH4ogXEsoWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg,Yes,http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=dW3ziT31l8wigwGDGIeIqs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuACyYVCx5C3ke7l1cyfZhHWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg,"http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=Llk5uznDcomUXN34nByJ3c$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtP3wnjZyKsCKmfoBGjvEHVWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg ,

BRIGHTON | Authorities have released the name of a man who was killed during a gunfight with police in a quiet neighborhood in Brighton.

The Adams County coroner’s office said Friday that 32-year-old James Edward Strong died of multiple gunshot wounds.

Police say a narcotics warrant was being served at a home Thursday morning when Strong opened fire. One officer was shot twice and was hospitalized in stable condition.

NORTHGLENN - No criminal charges will be filed against two officers who shot and killed a Northglenn man during a drug raid.

Officers used a no-knock search warrant to enter the house at 109th Place on May 28.

According a letter from the Adams County District Attorney, the officers believed 32-year-old James Strong Jr. was dealing cocaine out of the house. The officers said Strong was in a darkened bedroom and he started shooting as they opened the door.

Two officers said they feared for their lives and returned fire, hitting Strong nearly 20 times. He died on the scene.

One officer was injured by the gunfire.

Several children were in the home at the time of the 10 a.m. raid. Officers said prior surveillance indicated the kids and their mom usually left at 8:30 a.m., however, the raid happened on the first day of summer break.

9Wants to Know spoke to Strong's fiancée who disputes the officers' account.

She says she was sleeping in the bedroom with Strong when the officers burst through the front door. She claims the officers fired their weapons first.

CUMBERLAND COUNTY, Ky. (WKYT) - Cumberland County dispatchers confirm to WKYT that the search for wanted man Floyd Ray Cook is now over.


According to a press release from Kentucky State Police, shots were fired at 12:21 a.m. Friday. Troopers stated they were searching an embankment near a home on Kentucky 61 about seven miles south of Burkesville when they found Cook. Two troopers and a U.S. Marshall saw him, and began shooting when Cook opened fire first.

Cook was wounded by the officers, and the Cumberland County Coroner pronounced him dead at the scene. No officers were hurt.

Cook had been on the run for nearly a week, after shooting an officer in Tennessee, and shooting at an officer in Kentucky.

WKYT is working to gather more details on this breaking situation and will update this story as soon as more details come into the newsroom.

 Fugitive rapist Floyd Ray Cook shot, killed by Kentucky police 2:31
A rapist who was the target of a six-day manhunt after allegedly shooting a Tennessee cop was killed by police early Friday in what officials described as a ""scary"" conclusion.

Floyd Ray Cook, 62, was fatally shot near Burkesville, Kentucky, after being traced to a wooded area with the help of a police helicopter's thermal camera.

Law enforcement agents converged on a building in the hunt for Cook, who was accused of shooting a Tennessee police officer during a traffic stop on Saturday.

Kentucky State Police Trooper Billy Gregory said two colleagues and a U.S. Marshal encountered the fugitive on an embankment near Kentucky Route 61 about seven miles south of Burkesville.

""Cook had a handgun and gunfire was exchanged,"" Gregory said. ""Cook was wounded and was pronounced dead at the scene. No officers were injured.""

Earlier, Cook approached a home in Cumberland County near the Tennessee border at around 2:40 p.m. local time (3:40 p.m. ET) and asked for a ride, but the couple refused and called police, Gregory said.

Investigators had described Cook as ""armed and dangerous"" and he was close to a residence when finally caught, Gregory said.

""Tonight was a scary moment. We didn't know where he was, he could have been hiding in a tree, around a tree, in a bush or what have you. We are just grateful that no-one else was injured.""

Cook was wanted on felony warrants out of Kentucky and for attempted murder of an officer after allegedly shooting Officer Ahscari Valencia once in the chest on Saturday in Tennessee. Valencia survived and has since been released from the hospital.

Two ""dangerous"" acquaintances of Cook, Katy McCarty, 35, and Troy Wayne, 50, were detained Wednesday night and being questioned following a chase and search in the woods.

""I can speak entirely for the community that we are relieved the manhunt has finally come to an end,"" said John Phelps Jr., Cumberland County judge/executive. ""Everyone has been on edge, not knowing where he might be, not knowing where he was at. He seemed to be a very elusive character.""

Gregory thanked the community for providing tips that helped narrow the search.

""It definitely should be notes that we've been getting information from all kinds of sources,"" he told reporters. Without that information, ""we'd still be combing the entire state of Kentucky.""

He said investigators were ""a little bit surprised"" at Cook's apparent resourcefulness ""given his age.""

""I don't know what resources he had available to him, we may not ever know,"" he said.

Phelps said the manhunt had been ""tragic"" and ""scary"" for the local community.

""We're a very close-knit community … country folk. We're not accustomed to seeing those kinds of things happening here,"" he said. ""It all that's been talked about since Saturday evening. It's been very nerve-wracking, everyone wants to carry on with normal lives.

Friends of Daquan Antonio Westbrook say he longed for recognition and stardom.

The 18-year-old Charlotte man, who used the name “Donkey Cartel” on social media, had the persona of an up-and-coming rapper. He posted his beats and lyrics on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, where he sang about guns, women, shooting people and prison. And he had a long criminal record.

But few knew his name until Christmas Eve.

In a crowded Northlake Mall packed with last-minute shoppers Thursday afternoon, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said, an argument between two groups of people escalated with gunshots. One of the gunmen pointed a weapon at an off-duty officer who had responded to the gunfire, police said. The officer shot Westbrook, killing him.

The shooting and the chaos at the mall was covered on network news broadcasts, on national websites and lit up social media, yielding hashtags such as “Northlake Mall” and “ripDonk,” that became trending topics on Twitter. Northlake was forced to close for about half a day on one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

As police continue to sort out what happened, more is being learned about Westbrook.

Brotherly concern

Speculation about what motivated the fight has been rampant on social media.

Manny Sadek, a videographer who produced Westbrook’s music videos for the past two years, believes it could be connected with a Thanksgiving incident, when Westbrook’s brother was shot. That brother, whose nickname is “Wop,” continues to recuperate in the hospital.

“After that situation, things got a little more heated,” Sadek said. “I felt like something was coming, but I didn’t know what.”

On Thanksgiving night, Westbrook took to Twitter to ask people to pray for his brother, and added, “Love U big Bra. Everything gone be good Wop.”

Criminal history

Inside the north Charlotte mall Thursday, at least two people involved in the dispute pulled guns and opened fire on the mall’s lower level, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Chief Kerr Putney said. Witnesses said the gunfire started outside of the Journeys shoe store near Dick’s Sporting Goods, and some said they heard as many as 10 shots.

As hundreds of panicked shoppers scrambled for safety, off-duty police officers working at the mall responded. Putney said witnesses told police that when off-duty Officer Thomas Ferguson reached the scene, one of the gunmen turned and pointed his weapon at the officer.

Ferguson fired his service weapon, and Westbrook was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

A 19-year CMPD veteran, Ferguson was placed on paid, administrative leave, which is standard procedure after officer-involved shootings.

A police spokesman could not be reached for comment Friday.

Westbrook’s arrest record detailed a criminal history since 2013 that involved drugs, guns and stolen property, and listed addresses in Charlotte and Gastonia. His most recent arrest stemmed from a Nov. 14 incident that led to misdemeanor drug charges, records show.

Westbrook also faced trial on felony counts from incidents in April, September and October, including charges of possession of a firearm by a felon, possessing a weapon on educational property, possession with intent to sell/deliver marijuana, and aiding and abetting larceny. And he faced trial on several misdemeanor drug charges.

In 2013, Westbrook received probation after a felony conviction of possession of stolen goods/property.

‘A good guy’

Friends upset by the media’s portrayal of Westbrook jumped to his defense. Others condemned a widely shared photo of his body on the mall floor. Briana Wright was one of them.

She and Westbrook grew up around each other in Charlotte. Westbrook, who had another nickname, “Dada,” was known as a “goofy little brother” who tried to make others laugh, Wright said.

“He was a good guy,” she said. “We were all just put in situations … we had no control over. He didn’t deserve to lose his life and have his picture broadcast through all avenues of social media.”

Westbrook’s mother told WSOC-TV her son attended Gaston Community College and wanted to work in construction.

Sadek said his friend “was becoming a better man.”

When Sadek met Westbrook, the aspiring rapper was 16, in and out of trouble with police and sporting two ankle bracelets, Sadek said. But over time, Westbrook’s rocky past gave way to his “strong heart” and raw talent, he said.

“He got a job, got off both ankle bracelets and was turning his life around,” Sadek said.

Westbrook was part of a group of north Charlotte musicians dubbed “Cartel Music Group,” Sadek said. Many of their videos can be found on YouTube.

Westbrook, who last shot a video with Sadek on Wednesday, was also an expectant father.

“That was his main, main concern,” Sadek said. “Every year, he was progressing to be a man. He’s not a thug (or) criminal. He wasn’t going to the mall to shoot up the mall.”

Police said the shooting was not a random act of violence.

Final tweets

Shortly after 8 a.m. on Christmas Eve, Westbrook took to Twitter and posted that he was going to work all weekend because “Santa Clause Ain’t payin’ no Bills.”

At 9:14 a.m., he tweeted out a link to one of his videos, “223 Freestyle,” where he sang, “When them guns cock you better duck b-----.”

Referring to some of the lyrics in Westbrook’s songs, Sadek said, “People don’t understand that level of hip-hop. (Music) was his way of venting his life and frustrations.”

Westbrook’s tweet linking to “223 Freestyle” was his final post.

Five hours later, at 2:10 p.m., police received a call about the shooting.

Westbrook’s mother, Charlotte resident Sheana Shirley, had posted links to her son’s various videos on her Facebook page.

She returned to Facebook shortly before 2 a.m. on Christmas Day with a clear message. She berated people “that wished that on my baby. I do know my baby in heaven.”

Christmas Eve descended into chaos Thursday when shots were fired between two groups at a north Charlotte mall and a responding off-duty police officer shot and killed one of the alleged gunmen.

Northlake Mall was jammed with last-minute holiday shoppers when an argument broke out between two groups involved in an ongoing dispute. At least two of the people involved pulled guns and opened fire, on the mall’s lower level near Dick’s Sporting Goods, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said.

Witnesses say hundreds of panicked bystanders screamed and shoved to get away from the area. Others dove under tables at the nearby food court.

Police working at the mall responded. CMPD Chief Kerr Putney said witnesses told police that when off-duty officer Thomas Ferguson reached the scene, one of the gunmen turned and pointed his weapon at Ferguson.

The officer fired his service weapon, Putney said. Daquan Antonio Westbrook, 18, was pronounced dead at the scene. At an evening news conference, Putney said police did not know if the teenager fired any shots at the officer.

Records indicate Westbrook had a lengthy criminal record involving guns, drugs and violence.

Per CMPD policy, Ferguson, a 19-year veteran of the force, has been placed under paid, administrative leave, Putney said.

A chaotic scene

The gunfire – some witnesses reported hearing up to 10 shots – sent shoppers scrambling and shoving down mall walkways and running up escalators before they streamed into the parking lot. Some hid behind dumpsters. Others waited for up to 30 minutes as gates to some of the stores came down and blocked their departures. The movie theater was placed on lockdown.

W.T. Harris Boulevard, the heavily traveled main gateway to the mall, became a quagmire as hundreds of cars tried to leave the mall, just as dozens of police cars were barreling to the scene.

Motorists who made it out of the parking lot found ramps to Interstate 77 closed. Dozens of other shoppers left the area on foot or watched from the periphery as police cars, fire trucks and ambulances cordoned off the mall. Still others sat in their cars and tried to compose themselves before driving off.

“I need a cigarette, and I don’t smoke,” said Natasha Columbus of Charlotte, who was shopping about 20 feet from the shooting and initially thought the mall was under terrorist attack.

Witnesses said the gunfire started outside of Journeys, a shoe store on the lower level of the mall near Dick’s.

Zindy Cruz, 19, was in the food court with her brother and father when they heard shots being fired. They ducked under their table until things calmed down.

From the second floor, they could see into Journeys, where she said she saw a man lying on the floor who appeared dead.

Co-workers Nicole Kirkpatrick and Columbus were in the Locker Room Sporting Goods store on the lower level of the mall near Journeys when shots rang out.

“Pow, pow, pow, pow,” eight or nine in all, Kirkpatrick said.

Columbus said she bolted to the back of the store. Kirkpatrick went to the front, toward the sound of gunfire, and craned to see.

Fifteen to 20 feet away, she said, she saw a body.

In the same store, Lisa Sawyer Phillips, 46, and her oldest son, 26, were looking for Carolina Panthers T-shirts when they heard the shots. Customers ran to the back of the store, where workers escorted them through a back door that leads to a hallway, Phillips said.

They waited there for 30 minutes before they were able to evacuate the mall, she said.

“That was probably the scariest part, not knowing how many people were actually shooting,” Phillips said.

“Usually, I’m calm and collected and can handle things,” she said. But as the sound of gunshots hit the air, “I really broke down.”


Caryl Santos, a 20-year-old sophomore at East Carolina University, said she was standing in the checkout line at Belk when suddenly people began running toward the exit. “I had no idea what to do, so I grabbed my mom, dropped my stuff and ran out of the store,” she said.

The scene was chaotic, she said: People ran to their cars. Some hid behind dumpsters.

Justin Biddle, 19, and his girlfriend Chyna Williams, 17, were at the mall for some last-minute shopping for her mother. They had gotten off the escalator in Macy’s and headed for Victoria’s Secret when dozens of shoppers – “too many to count,” Chyna said – thundered toward them.

They ran with the crowd, they said, asking questions as they went.

Shots had been fired, they were told, and someone had been hit.

By the time they reached the parking lot, the first of dozens of squealing police cars were taking over the mall.

Minutes later, they stood in a light rain, holding hands, waiting for their ride, feeling lucky they hadn’t reached the mall any earlier.

“We feel blessed that we weren’t shot,” Biddle said. But he said the couple felt bad for anyone who had been hurt and their families.

Westbrook’s short life featured a long list of criminal charges – from larceny and drugs to assaults and firearms. In 2014, he was charged with shooting a 12-year-old in northeast Charlotte. His most recent arrests took place in October, and were related to drugs, larceny and resisting arrest.

Staying at home

Northlake Mall, which opened in September 2005, is a 1.1-million square foot enclosed regional shopping center on the northwest corner of I- 77 and W.T. Harris Boulevard. In 2014, original owner Taubman Center Inc. sold the mall to Starwood Capital Group.

In 2009, Northlake launched a curfew requiring adult supervision for anyone under age 18 on Fridays and Saturdays after 5 p.m.

In 2012, a man was arrested and charged in connection with a shooting outside of the Dick’s and Dillard’s at Northlake.

Ninety minutes after Thursday’s shooting, shopper Natasha Columbus said she still was shaken over what she heard. She doesn’t like public places to begin with. Her experience at Northlake had changed her holiday plans.

“I’m staying in the house,” she said.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — An off-duty police officer who shot and killed an 18-year-old firing a gun at a Charlotte mall on Christmas Eve will not be charged with a crime.

The Mecklenburg County district attorney’s office said in a news release Thursday that Officer T.E. Ferguson saw the teen fire a shot into the Journeys store at Northlake Mall after being called to a fight.

Prosecutors say Ferguson shot 18-year-old Daquan Westbrook four times and he died shortly after.

Authorities say a man in the store was wounded and ran from the store. He later showed up at a hospital and refused to help police.

The shooting caused chaos in the mall with last-minute shoppers locking themselves in stores.

Huntsville police killed a man they say threatened responding officers with a knife on East Gateway Drive Monday night.

It started when the man got into an altercation with his brother at an apartment in the 11000 block and ended up cutting him, said police spokesman Lt. Darryl Lawson. He said the brother ran to a neighbor's apartment to call police. The suspect followed his brother there and stabbed the neighbor as well, he said.

Lawson said two officers arrived at the scene simultaneously while the suspect was running downstairs from the upper-level apartment. He said the man was yelling at the officers while charging at them. The officers yelled back at him to drop the knife, but he continued to advance, Lawson said. 

""He continued to charge at the officers. The officers were forced to shoot him,"" Lawson said. He could not confirm if both officers fired or just one of them.

The suspect was rushed to Huntsville Hospital but died of his injuries.

The neighbor and brother were also taken to Huntsville Hospital. Lawson said the neighbor's stabbing injuries are life-threatening. The brother's are not.

The police officers were not injured. They are now on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. This is standard procedure when an officer fires a weapon.

The man's name has not been released yet, and the investigation is ongoing. Investigators from major crimes, internal affairs and crime scene units were called to the scene.

A neighbor in an apartment across the street said this is quiet neighborhood and police calls are rare.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WHNT) - Two Huntsville police officers are on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation into a deadly officer-involved shooting.

A 911 call came in just before 10 p.m. Monday about a stabbing in the 11000 block of East Gateway Drive, just off of Hobbs Road east of Memorial Parkway.  Police say Anthony Dewayne Briggs, 36, and his brother, Quinten Briggs, 21, both live in the complex but in different units.

Police say Anthony went downstairs to the apartment where Quinten and his mother live and began banging on the door and yelling at Quinten to come outside.  When Quinten opened the door, officers say Anthony swung a knife and him, cutting him on both arms.  Quinten went back inside and locked the door.

Police say a neighbor, Matthew Hook, came outside to see what was happening.  Officers say Anthony Briggs ran back down the steps and began swinging at Hook.  Hook went back in his apartment and realized he had been cut, and called police.

Two officers responded and saw Anthony Briggs on the second floor of the apartment building.  Officers say he came downstairs, charging at them with a knife, screaming at them. The officers yelled back at him, ordering him to drop the knife and put his hands up.  Police say Anthony Briggs refused to comply and continued to charge at them.  The officers shot him.  He was taken to Huntsville Hospital by ambulance, where he died.

Quentin Briggs and Matthew Hook were both taken to the hospital for treatment, but were released.

The two officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave while the incident is under investigation.  This is standard procedure.  An Incident Review Board will hear evidence and testimony in the case.

Family Reaction

Family members of Anthony Briggs told WHNT News 19 that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia years ago. They say the 36-year old took medication for his illness.

""He has had his little episodes, but nothing this bad before, nothing this severe,"" said one family member.

She also said that she believes police officers went too far in trying to stop her relative.

""Lethal force should have never been taken like that for a person who has a mental disease. Even if he did have a knife in his hand, they have strategies and tactics to take down somebody like that.""

An Indianapolis man shot by police officers early Thursday after they say he waved a gun as they entered his Southwestside home with a search warrant has died.

Jason Bryant, 34, was pronounced dead at Eskenazi Hospital hours after he was shot by officers from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department at his home in the 2200 block of Conrad Avenue, according to police.

IMPD Lt. Rich Riddle said the incident began around 1:30 a.m. when officers tried to stop the truck Bryant was driving.

Riddle said Bryant fled from officers who chased the truck until they saw him ditch the vehicle and go into the home. Police determined the truck was stolen from Whiteland on Nov. 23.

Officers surrounded the home until they secured a search warrant to enter, Riddle said.

When police went inside the home around 5:30 a.m., they saw Bryant sitting in a back bedroom with a gun, Riddle said.

Two officers, a 28-year veteran sergeant and a 12-year veteran patrol officer, fired their weapons, striking the suspect, police said. Bryant did not fire his gun.

Bryant was then rushed to Eskenazi where he later died, police said.

A second search warrant served at the house led to the discovery of a handgun, police said. Bryant was out on bond for a separate case with charges of dealing and possession of methamphetamine, and being a serious violent felon in possession of a handgun.

The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave. They are both assigned to the Southwest District.

The shooting happened in the 2100 block of Conrad Avenue shortly before 5:30 a.m.

According to IMPD, around 1:43 a.m., officers attempted to stop a vehicle near the intersection of South Belmont Avenue and Conrad Avenue for a license plate violation. 

The man did not stop and eventually got out of his vehicle and ran. 

After looking at the truck, officers learned it had been stolen from New Whiteland, Indiana, on Nov. 23.

Officers believed the man ran into a home in the 2100 block of Conrad Avenue. Officers were granted a search warrant and went into the home shortly before 5:30 a.m. 

When they entered the home, two officers encountered 34-year-old Jason Bryant, of Indianapolis, armed with a gun in a back bedroom. Both officers shot the suspect. Bryant was transported to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition. He later died of his injuries.

A search warrant executed at Bryant's house turned up a .38-caliber handgun, which police say he pointed at officers just prior to being shot.

Bryant was out on bond for on charges of dealing and possession of methamphetamine and being a serious violent felon in possession of a handgun.

IMPD said the officers involved in the shooting were a 28-year veteran sergeant and a 12-year veteran patrol officer.

The involved officers will be placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings.

An attorney representing the relatives of Daniel Brumley, who was shot four times by a Fort Worth police officer on Jan. 17, said the autopsy report raises more questions about what happened that night. Brumley’s relatives and a handful of Northside activists have been at odds with the police over a range of issues, including the length of time the investigation is taking, the dearth of information being shared by police, and the manner in which the arresting officer handled the situation (“Blood on Whose Hands?” Feb. 25, 2015). Two bullets, according to the autopsy, entered Brumley’s back. A third hit him in his side and traveled in a downward motion. And a shot to his head entered near the left temple and passed through the right jaw, indicating the shot was fired in a downward motion.

Police officials have said the officer was behind Brumley when the suspect attacked him with a knife. Police haven’t named the officer involved in the shooting, but an official said the officer is small in stature. Brumley, the 25-year-old father of seven children, stood well over 6 feet tall.

Almost three months have passed since the shooting in the Diamond Oaks neighborhood of North Fort Worth. Brumley’s relatives are waiting for police to explain what happened and to address witness statements that seem to contradict police statements. Two witnesses said they saw a police officer lead a man to the back of a police car just before the shots rang out. Afterward, the officer acted suspiciously, including pacing nervously until backup police arrived, at which time he dropped to the ground and writhed in pain, the witnesses said.

Police and city officials are not releasing public information about the shooting, including the autopsy report, while the investigation is ongoing. However, a county official released the autopsy to Brumley’s mother, Jessica Castillo, who shared it with Fort Worth Weekly.

The Brumley family’s lawyer, Eloy Sepulveda, questioned why the police officer didn’t search Brumley or wait for a backup unit to arrive after learning there was a warrant for Brumley’s arrest.

Sepulveda visited Larry Moore, the Tarrant County district attorney’s criminal division chief, last week to express concerns about the report.

“I wanted to find out if the DA’s office had received the case of Brumley’s death and, if so, where they were in their investigation and evaluation of the case,” Sepulveda said.

Moore knew of other shootings involving police, such as the one in Grapevine in February, but said he hadn’t heard about the Brumley shooting, Sepulveda recalled.

“He assured me he would keep me abreast of it and how the investigation was going,” Sepulveda said.

Moore looked into the case, which is still under investigation.

“I’m not sure when we will get it,” Moore said. “It depends on how much info there is out there to gather.”

He and other administrators under new DA Sharen Wilson will be pushing to process cases in an efficient and expeditious manner, he said. Still, there is no official timeline.

“Every case is individual and fact-specific, and there may be issues on a particular case that I’m not aware of,” he said.

The Brumley shooting occurred at about 4 a.m. after he dropped off a friend at her house. He allegedly rolled through a stop sign a block away near Northeast 36th Street while heading back to his mother’s house in West Fort Worth. Police said a canine officer patrolling with a police dog in the backseat saw the traffic violation and stopped Brumley. The officer collected his driver’s license, saw he was wanted for warrants related to unpaid traffic tickets and child support, and removed Brumley from his car to take him into custody, police said.

“Brumley was armed with a knife and attacked the officer with violent and distinct lethal intent, stabbing the officer several times,” police Sgt. William Hix said. “The officer determined in a matter of seconds that his life was in jeopardy and responded to that threat with the only reasonable force option that was available. This force option to shoot [Brumley] was predicated on Brumley’s actions. The officer sustained stab wounds and was transported to a local hospital for treatment of those injuries.”

The officer was reportedly treated and released.

Sepulveda said the number of shots fired and the directions the bullets traveled are troublesome.

“We could speculate on how that happened,” he said. “I told [Moore] I’d like to know how the officer explained that.”

The attorney also questioned the officer’s tactics.

“I read [police] reports everyday,” Sepulveda said. “These officers, once they got a confirmed warrant, they call for backup and wait for backup to show up if they know they’re going to have to pull a guy out of the car. Another thing, as soon as they pull a guy out of the car they pat him down. According to the witnesses, that didn’t happen. This officer was incompetent or didn’t know what he was doing.”

Hix said the officer followed protocol.

Brumley’s relatives say he never carried a knife and had never been violent with police despite several arrests over the years. A witness said he saw the police officer’s gun lying in the street after the shooting but didn’t see a knife. Later, he saw a knife lying next to the gun.

The autopsy report shows Brumley had an abrasion on his left forehead, left upper cheek, and left lower back and contusions on his right knee and left leg, as well as deep cuts on his right fingers.

“Normally that would indicate a defensive move,” Sepulveda said of the cuts on Brumley’s fingers. “The person who winds up with a cut like that is grabbing a knife, and the blade portion of the knife is being thrust against him. It cut all four fingers in a horizontal direction.”

The autopsy showed Brumley tested positive for methamphetamine. The woman he had been with for six or seven hours prior to the shooting said Brumley had one alcoholic drink, did not do any drugs, and showed no signs of intoxication. Brumley texted the woman within minutes of dropping her off to tell her he’d been stopped by police.

Brumley parked under a streetlight near H.M. Moore Elementary School. Witnesses said the scene was well lit except toward the back of the patrol car.

“If he had patted him down when he got out of the car, he would have found any weapon he might have had,” Sepulveda said. “Both witnesses say [Brumley] got out of the car and was told to walk to the back, and the officer followed him. He walked him to his patrol car, and you wonder what he was going to do to him. You’d think he was going to put him in his patrol car, but he couldn’t do that … because he had a [police] dog in the back. They walked past the door.”

The crime scene indicated the shooting occurred near the back end of the police car.

Sepulveda, who has worked as an attorney on the North Side since 1978, said he’d heard many times in recent years that police are heavy-handed.

“I’ve heard a lot of stories in my office about people being abused by police,” he said. “This is not surprising to me. I tend to give it credibility when I hear it. When there is a case like this, nothing surprises me.”

Relatives of Northside shooting victims have met with community activists to discuss their concerns. Dep. Chief Charlie Ramirez attended a meeting and verbally clashed with several people who claimed the police department covered up for abusive officers (“Piling on Trouble,” March 4, 2015). The next day, police officers went to the home of Jesse Urias, a Northside man who lives alone, despite being partially mentally incapacitated, on North Houston Street. His friend and landlord, Willie Goodwin, lives nearby and helps Urias as needed.

Police officers, attempting to serve a warrant on a suspect, knocked on Urias’ door. Urias told them he lived alone and had never heard of the suspect. He said police called him a liar, cursed at him, broke his door, and entered his home without permission. Goodwin hustled over and calmed down the situation. Ramirez visited Urias and vowed to look into the situation. The Weekly has asked for the results of Ramirez’ investigation several times but has received no update.

FORT WORTH 
A Tarrant County grand jury has declined to indict a police officer who fatally wounded a 27-year-old north Fort Worth resident who had stabbed the officer, according to court officials.

Fort Worth police officer Chris Jones shot and killed Daniel Brumley after pulling him over on Jan. 17 in the 1700 block of N.E. 36th Street. A scuffle began, and Brumley stabbed Jones in the leg.

Brumley, the father of seven, was shot multiple times, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office.

Jones was treated at a hospital.

“I was told it was a superficial wound,” Brumley’s sister Veronica Castillo said Thursday. “Why weren’t the officer’s hospital records pulled that showed he had a superficial wound?”

In a news release, Sharen Wilson, the Tarrant County district attorney, said she agreed with the grand jury, which handed up its decision on Wednesday.

“This incident centered on an aggressive repeat offender high on methamphetamines and marijuana who stabbed a police officer performing his normal duties,” Wilson’s statement said. “The officer defended himself in a justified manner. The attorney for Mr. Brumley’s family was given the opportunity to address the grand jurors. When presented with the unbiased facts, the grand jury was resolute in its ultimate decision.”

Brumley’s family and other residents of Fort Worth’s north side community have protested the way the case was handled and participated in protests this year about police-involved shootings.

“We were told the drugs in his system could have been a day or two old,” Castillo said. “The only thing they took under consideration is his past. I know how my brother is. This wasn’t the first time he had been pulled over. It wouldn’t have been the first time he went to jail. He has never resisted. He always laughed it off.”

The family’s attorney, Eloy Sepulveda, said he appreciated the opportunity to make a presentation before the grand jury but wished it had done more good.

“It was very disappointing,” he said. “I made a passionate plea for the grand jury to indict [the officer]. It just didn’t happen.”

Sepulveda said Brumley’s case was not an isolated incident.

“I do believe this type of thing is happening to Hispanics quite a bit,” Sepulveda said. “Hispanics comprise more than 20 percent of the population in Fort Worth. It seems as though police do not know how to handle situations with people other than shooting them.”

Seattle police are investigating the death of a 64-year-old mentally ill man who county medical investigators say died as a result of an injury suffered during his arrest earlier this month.

Shun Ma was arrested at his Beacon Hill home Dec. 3 on suspicion of threatening to kill his brother. After police handcuffed him, he was immediately taken to Harborview Medical Center for treatment of an elbow injury sustained during his struggle with officers, Seattle Police Assistant Chief Robert Merner said.

On Dec. 5, Ma was charged in Seattle Municipal Court with misdemeanor harassment for threatening his brother.

Wednesday morning, Ma’s sister contacted police to recover his belongings that were taken into evidence when he was arrested. Detectives learned during her call that Ma had died, police said in a news release. The man had died in the hospital’s intensive-care unit Tuesday, police said.

Ma had been at Harborview since his arrest, police said, though it’s unclear why he was there so long.

On Wednesday afternoon, an investigator with the King County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled that Ma died from a pulmonary embolus, or blood clot, sustained after “an altercation with police.” The office said Ma’s “schizophrenia with out of control and threatening behavior” contributed to his death.

After doing an autopsy, a county medical investigator rules whether someone has died of a homicide, suicide or accidental death. In Ma’s case, the office ruled he died of a homicide.

In a written statement, police said the department and the “King County Medical Examiner’s office are working to review details surrounding the death of a 64-year-old man, who sustained non-life-threatening injuries during an arrest earlier this month. It appears other medical factors played a significant role in his death.”

Merner said the department’s Force Investigation Team and the Office of Professional Accountability are investigating the circumstances surrounding Ma’s arrest.

Wood Ma, 55, said his older brother had been battling mental illness for more than 20 years. Shun Ma lived on state assistance, spending his days exercising, going to the library or walking to the Chinatown-International District, his brother said.

In the days leading to his arrest, Shun Ma was quick to anger and had been refusing to take his mental-health medications, his brother said.

“He would go crazy, yelling around the house,” the younger brother said.

On Dec. 3, Wood Ma said, he was in a bedroom and his brother was yelling at him.

“He accused me of stealing his medications. He said if I didn’t give them back to him he’d kill me,” Wood Ma said.

The younger brother dialed 911 and said that five or six police officers were at their home within 15 minutes. Officers ordered Wood Ma to remain in his room while they tried to reason with his brother, Wood Ma said.

As officers handcuffed Shun Ma, he told them he worked for the FBI, Wood Ma said.

The younger brother said he didn’t see the arrest, nor did he hear his brother yell out in pain or complain about being injured.

The Ma family assumed Shun Ma was fine and heading to jail, until they received a call from a doctor at Harborview Medical Center on Monday telling them that he was in critical condition, Wood Ma said.

“I was kind of surprised,” Wood Ma said. He said the family decided to remove life support Monday.

Wood Ma didn’t know medical investigators had ruled his brother’s death a homicide. He said he doesn’t blame police for the death.

“My brother was out of control. I would say the officers did it the right way,” he said about the arrest.

SEATTLE -- Since moving to Seattle from Hong Kong, Wood and Shun Ma always lived together. They took care of each other, Wood said. His brother battled mental illness while he, most recently, worked in maintenance at a local community college.

Wood Ma said he never had a problem with his brother until December 4, when Shun threatened to kill him.

""He suspected me to steal his medicine,"" said Wood. ""If I didn't return his medicine, he would kill me. I called 9-1-1.""

Seattle police showed up and, according to Ma, his brother fought back with a broomstick. He heard, but did not see, a scuffle in the entry of their house.

Shun Ma, 64, was arrested, but taken to Harborview Medical Center with a broken elbow. It's that injury, according to the King County Medical Examiner, that led to Shun's death Tuesday.

In a report made public Wednesday afternoon, the King County Medical Examiner determined Ma's death was a homicide. A blood clot in his lung was the result of an existing injury. Other mitigating factors besides the scuffle with police, according to the report, Ma's own schizophrenic and threatening behavior.

Wood Ma said he is not upset with police because he did not see the fight itself. More than anything, he said, he is sad his brother is gone.

""It's very, very hard,"" he explained. ""Frustration, confusion. It's all of that.""

The case is now being investigated by Seattle's Office of Professional Accountability, the police department's watchdog.

The Seattle Police Department released this statement:

The Seattle Police Department and King County Medical Examiner's office are working to review details surrounding the death of a 64-year-old man, who sustained non-life-threatening injuries during an arrest earlier this month. It appears other medical factors played a significant role in his death.

On the morning of December 3rd, police responded to a Beacon Hill home after receiving a report that a 64-year-old brother was in crisis and had threatened to kill a family member.

Police arrived at the home and took the 64-year-old man into custody. During the arrest, the man struggled with officers and sustained a non-life-threatening injury to his elbow.

Seattle Fire Department medics treated the man at the scene before a private ambulance transported him to Harborview Medical Center, where he was held for crisis treatment.

The 64-year-old man remained at Harborview until December 14th, when he suffered from a medical episode. He was transferred to the hospital's Intensive Care Unit, where he later died.

The department learned of the man's death yesterday after members of his family contacted detectives to inquire about retrieving his property.",Yes,Yes,http://www.king5.com/img/resize/content.king5.com/photo/2015/12/16/635859082801144852-shunma_286504_ver1.0.JPG?preset=534-401,No,,http://www.king5.com/news/local/seattle/seattle-man-dies-days-after-arrest-fighting-police/45166976,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Morning,Indoors,Other.

Dana Ott 
A man shot by Colorado Springs police two months ago when investigators say he threatened them with an air rifle died Friday morning from those injuries, the El Paso Sheriff's Office announced.

Dana Bruce Ott, 63, died in a hospital where he had been recovering since the Nov. 10 shooting outside his Mountain Shadows home, said Jacqueline Kirby, an El Paso County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman. 

An autopsy was completed Friday, but a final report is not expected for several weeks.

Two officers shot Ott in his lower abdomen while responding to a disturbance at his house, 5120 Lanagan St., according to the 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office. The officers shot Ott when he raised the weapon and pointed it at them, the District Attorney's Office said.

Moments before opening fire, the officers said they heard Ott say something to the effect of ""Shoot me,"" an arrest affidavit said. Ott ignored their calls to drop his rifle, the affidavit said.

Investigators later learned Ott was holding an air rifle - though there were no markings on it, such as an orange safety tip, to suggest it wasn't an actual gun - the District Attorney's Office said. Ott also had unused pellet rounds in his pocket.

The District Attorney's Office declined to charge the officers, Matthew Peterson and Derek Wilson, because it said they ""acted reasonably and were justified in defending themselves,"" according to a statement. They returned to work the week following the shooting.

Ott was arrested on suspicion of multiple counts of menacing, including charges related to the domestic disturbance. However, he never left the hospital, Kirby said.

His next scheduled court date was Feb. 8.

A licensed but inactive attorney, Ott lived in the Mountain Shadows neighborhood for years - and decided during the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire not to evacuate as flames licked the hillside above his house.

""I'm telling you, there is nothing going,"" Ott told The Gazette as the fire raged. ""Some bureaucrat made a bad decision and no one is willing to own up to that.""

He won $390,601 a year later in the World Series of Poker tournament for seniors.

The day of the shooting, police suspect an argument between Ott, his housemate and the housemate's sister led the two women to call 911.

The housemate, who had been living with Ott since 2002, said Ott was drinking bourbon and was on antidepressants and strong painkillers before the shooting, according to the affidavit.

The Salt Lake County district attorney's office Monday found that Salt Lake City police officer Matthew Taylor was justified in fatally shooting Avenues resident James Dudley Barker after Barker struck Taylor with a snow shovel multiple times in a scuffle that left Taylor with a broken arm and foot.

Taylor said he ""knew [he] was in a lot of trouble"" when Barker hit him with the snow shovel Jan. 8, after Taylor questioned Barker about a neighbor's report that Barker was acting suspiciously. The neighbor had called 911 about 3:30 p.m. to report a man was knocking on doors to seek work shoveling snow. The neighbor said the same man earlier that week was looking into car windows.

Barker, 42, was at a home near 2nd Avenue and I Street, about one block from his own home, when Taylor spotted him.

In footage from Taylor's body camera, he can be heard repeatedly asking Barker's name, saying neighbors reported his behavior was suspicious. After a brief, relatively calm conversation, Barker can be seen growing agitated and shouting at Taylor.

The encounter went from ""zero to 100,"" as Barker yelled and stuck a finger in Taylor's face, as Taylor later described in a police interview.

As Taylor can be seen in the footage moving forward — to go ""hands on"" and try to cuff Barker, the officer later told investigators — Barker jumps back and swings the shovel at Taylor, disabling the body camera.

Taylor said he fell off the porch and realized his arm was broken, according to a report released Monday by District Attorney Sim Gill. Taylor said he grabbed his Taser because he couldn't reach his gun. But Barker ""jumped on him"" and hit the Taser out of his hand, Taylor told investigators.

Barker also grabbed at Taylor's ""gun or holster at least twice,"" Taylor said.

""I know if he gets my gun, he's going to kill me,"" Taylor said, noting that he was especially concerned that Barker hadn't fled after knocking Taylor off the porch.

""I've had guys fight me, but they run away,"" Taylor told investigators. ""When I got knocked off, [Barker] had plenty of time to run away. He's still coming ... grabbing for my gun. His one goal was to try and kill me.""

Taylor said he pushed Barker off him and drew his gun, shooting Taylor three times from a ""couple of feet away.""

Eyewitnesses supplemented Taylor's account.

Richard Grow, who lives in the northwest corner of the Avenues, witnessed the final moments of the struggle between Taylor and Barker.

Grow, 66, was driving south on I Street when, as he approached 2nd Avenue, he saw the two men leap off a front porch, one after the other. In an interview with The Salt Lake Tribune, he said he is not sure if the officer was the first one off the porch; he initially thought they were two roommates fighting and only later realized that one was a policeman.

By the time Grow pulled up, stopping his car about 40 feet from the fight, the two men were wrestling on the ground in front of the house.

""They wrestled on the ground for 10 to 15 seconds,"" Grow said. Then he saw the officer ""reach around his side and pull out his gun and hold it up to the guy's chest and bam, bam, bam. ... point-blank against this man's chest.""

Grow got out and asked the officer, who Grow thought looked haggard, if he needed any help.

""He just said, 'Get out of here,' "" Grow said. He obeyed, but filled out a statement at police headquarters a few hours later.",Yes,Yes,NA,Yes,NA,NONE,http://www.ksl.com/?sid=33042457,Body-cam captures police interaction prior to fatal Avenues shooting,"Body-cam captures police interaction prior to fatal Avenues shooting

Editor's note: The contents of the raw body-cam footage are intense and may be stressful for some viewers.

SALT LAKE CITY — Less than three minutes after he was approached by a Salt Lake police officer, James Dudley Barker began to scream.

""I'm trying to make a living,"" Barker is seen yelling in footage captured by the officer's body camera Thursday afternoon. ""I'm doing my business!""

Barker, 42, refused to give his name or the name of the business he says he has a license for as the officer explains he is responding to calls from neighbors.

""You're suspicious in the neighborhood. People are calling in on you. … I didn't stop you for no reason,"" the officer says before radioing for assistance.

Barker is seen stepping back from the officer and cries, ""You can't get in my face, man!"" He then swings the snow shovel he is holding.

The video shows the sky as the officer presumably tumbles from the porch. The footage ends a second later as the blue shovel lands a second blow, breaking the camera.

The moment that followed seconds later, when Barker was shot and killed by the unidentified officer, was not recorded.

The officer was hit by the shovel ""several"" times, police said, and suffered fractured bones in an arm and foot.

Police released few new details Friday of the deadly shooting that took place just before 4 p.m. Thursday near Second Avenue and I Street, but made the body camera footage public.

Barker had allegedly been going door-to-door offering to shovel walkways for residents for money. There was also a report at the same time of a suspicious man looking into the windows of parked vehicles, according to police.

In the video, Barker is seen telling the officer that despite the warm weather, there is snow along the edges of the sidewalk he can remove. He then says he is looking for future business for when it snows again.

Police identify man killed in officer-involved shooting in Avenues
A man who allegedly was offering to shovel walks for money before hitting a Salt Lake City police officer with the shovel was shot and killed by the officer Thursday in Salt Lake City's Avenues area, according to police.
On Friday, a woman at the Avenues house where Barker was reportedly living declined comment. Other neighbors, however, said they were shocked by what happened.

""I don't know everything, but I do know James,"" said Ron Lee, a neighbor who lives a few doors away.

Lee said he and Barker had lunch at the Avenues Bistro on Third Avenue earlier in the week.

""He looked as good as I've ever seen him,"" he said.

Lee said Barker lived in his home on Third Avenue and I Street for 10 years and was outside regularly. He described him as a ""kind"" and ""normal guy"" who had shown ""absolutely no aggressiveness"" during the years he had known him.

Lee recalled a time when two trees were cut down in Barker's yard, and Barker was hesitant for the stump to be removed because he wanted to create something from it.

""Instead of just … cutting it down, (he said), 'Can't we make something beautiful?'"" Lee said, describing his friend's attitude.

Lee said he was surprised someone called the police on Barker because he had not known him to ever be suspicious.

""I just can't understand how a man would be shot,"" he said. ""As soon as you figure it out, send me a letter.""

Officers have a job to do, and frankly the amount of victim blaming on the officer is ridiculous and doesn't leave much air in the room for a rational discussion. That officer did nothing to provoke such an aggravated assault.
–Ian Adams, Utah Fraternal Order of Police
Court records show Barker's criminal history in Utah was relatively minor. He was arrested and booked into the Salt Lake County Jail in December 2013 for disturbing the peace and failing to give police his identity, according to a Salt Lake County Jail report.

In that incident, police say Barker walked into an area of a chocolate store on Main Street where customers weren't allowed and ""was acting strangely"" and ""severely disrupting operations,"" according to a jail report. Barker also had a warrant out of Salt Lake City at that time for theft of services, according to the jail report.

Ian Adams, spokesman for the Utah Fraternal Order of Police and a West Jordan police officer, said the video is a clear example of an officer ""doing his job.""

""Officers have a job to do, and frankly the amount of victim blaming on the officer is ridiculous and doesn't leave much air in the room for a rational discussion,"" Adams said. ""That officer did nothing to provoke such an aggravated assault.""

Chris Manor, however, disagrees. He and his group Utahns Against Police Brutality are planning a protest Saturday afternoon outside the Salt Lake City Public Safety Building. Manon said he believes the officer pushed Barker, and either man could have walked away before the conflict escalated.

""That begs the question, if the man has not committed the crime, is not being lawfully detained and arrested by the officer, should the officer have the right to put his hands on James Barker at that point?"" Manor said. ""If you do attack a policeman with a snow shovel after he's pushed, you're kind of playing your cards at that point, and it's probably not going to end well for you.""

Authorities kill man accused of attacking officer in Avenues
h
SALT LAKE CITY - A man who attacked a police officer with a shovel was shot and killed by police, who were responding to the Avenues area of Salt Lake City due to a homeowner who reported a suspicious person Thursday afternoon.

The incident occurred in the area of Second Avenue and I Street Thursday around 4 p.m., and on Friday the footage captured by the officer's body camera was released. See the link below.

Police identified the man who was shot as 42-year-old James Dudley Barker of Salt Lake City.

The person who called police stated the man was going door-to-door in the area and offering to shovel snow from people's sidewalks. There did not appear to be snow on walkways in the area where the shooting occurred.

The caller stated they thought this was the same man they saw in the area Wednesday, and the caller stated that man had been walking around and looking inside cars that day. The caller felt this was suspicious, so they contacted police when they saw the man again Thursday.

When the officer responded, he encountered Barker on the porch of a home in the area. Less than three minutes elapsed before the officer was attacked.

The officer told Barker they had received calls about a suspicious person, and he asked for the man's name or his business license.  Barker refused to provide that information, saying ""I'm just doing my business."" and  ""I'm not going to talk to you.""

The conversation continued , but eventually Barker appeared to become angry, especially as the officer pointed out there was no snow in the area and then asked for his name, insisting Barker was required by law to do so. Barker started to shout.

The volume increased as Barker shouted some more and the officer raised his voice in response, saying: ""I wouldn't just stop you for no reason, let me explain something to you....""

The audio becomes less distinct, as Barker continues to shout at the officer, who replies: ""OK, you need to calm down and quit yelling at me, right now.""

Barker insisted the officer needed to calm down, and eventually yelled very loudly: ""Go back to your car, I'm doing my business.""

Then the officer says into the radio: ""Bravo... send me another unit.""

Barker tells the officer to calm down, and then there is more shouting. About 20 seconds after the officer had told the man to quit yelling, Barker can be seen on video wielding the shovel with both hands as he attacks the officer. At that point the video tumbles downward.

Officials said it was at this point the officer drew and fired a weapon.

Sgt. Robin Heiden, Salt Lake City police, said the encounter unfolded very quickly.

""Immediately there was an altercation between the two,"" she said. ""The officer was attacked with the shovel and returned fire and killed the male.""

Police later stated that the officer involved is recovering from multiple fractured bones.

Police said the incident is under investigation. Police confirmed Thursday night that the officer was wearing a body camera and that it was turned on. Click here for that footage.

Cody Layton was in the area, and he said he heard the shots.

""It was pop, pop, pop,"" he said.

Layton said he immediately went to see what the commotion was.

""I looked out the window, and I saw an officer with a ball cap on, kind of clutching his arm--and so I knew something was up,"" he said.

The officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation, which is standard procedure in such incidents.

El Patron was packed Tuesday night, stuffed tight with college students celebrating the last week of the fall semester. Patrons crowded the bar, while a DJ played in the background.

Just before 1 a.m. Wednesday, the party atmosphere was interrupted when Dimitrie L. Penny, a 32-year-old who had been released from prison this summer, opened fire, Few people saw what was happening as they started to scramble, taking cover under tables and fleeing the Apalachee Parkway Mexican restaurant.

Penny started shooting inside the restaurant during a fight involving several people, said Tallahassee Police Department Chief Michael DeLeo in a briefing with reporters Wednesday.

Twenty-four-year-old Ira Brown was shot inside before the fight spilled out into the parking lot, where, police say,a 24-year-old woman and 25-year-old man were seriously shot and injured.

TPD officer Jason Ravenel shot at Penny, who was given first aid at the scene but died later at the hospital.

Ravenel and Officer Ed Guerra, who was also involved in the incident, were working at the restaurant providing off-duty security, DeLeo said. Both have been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation, as is TPD protocol.

TPD’s Violent Crimes and Forensic Units are conducting the investigation.

Details about what started the altercation are sparse, but DeLeo said several people were involved.

He said El Patron was extremely busy Tuesday night and there were several hundred people inside when the shooting broke out. DeLeo could not yet say if Penny fired at officers or whether both engaged him as he left the restaurant.

There is no security footage from inside the restaurant, but TPD detectives are seeking any outside footage that may assist in their investigation.

Former FSU player describes scene from El Patron shooting

The restaurant, co-owned by Alberto Munoz of Marianna, is normally a quiet place to grab tacos and a drink, but after dark, El Patron transforms into a jam-packed bar with cheap drink specials and music - sometimes live band and a DJ. The restaurant is popular with state workers for lunch, and in the evening the crowd gets younger.

Munoz said a few nights a week or during big weeks like homecoming or graduation in Tallahassee the restaurant would open to a more club-like crowd.

After Wednesday morning's shootings, he said he would be stopping the after-dinner party atmosphere and go back to operating El Patron solely as a restaurant.

He expressed condolences for the victims and said the shooting is not characteristic of the normal fun vibe where fights were rare. He was shocked to get a call about what happened.

""It triggers these kind of problems. We don’t need this kind of stuff,"" he said. ""This is just one of those things. We were prepared (with security and hired police officers.) Everybody that needed to be here was here.""

He said the capacity for the restaurant is 174 people, but was unsure how many people were inside Tuesday. He said security officials often stop allowing people to come inside once capacity is reached.

According to TPD records, officers were dispatched to El Patron 29 times since January 1 for a variety of reasons including for traffic incidents.

Tuesday nights are popular among college students. For many of them, going there to socialize is a weekly ritual. Wednesday morning's shooting brings Tallahassee's violent crime-related homicide count for 2015 to 14.

DeLeo made a plea to anyone who may have information about the shooting, saying it is impossible that everyone who was there had been interviewed.

""As you can imagine there are many details that we still do not know about what actually occurred and why it happened,"" DeLeo said. ""The victims, their family and friends and the community deserve to have all of their questions answered. We must demonstrate that violence is not a solution.""

A hotline to take tips specific to the shooting has been set up. Anyone with information is asked to call (850) 891-4331.

Penny was released from state prison in August.

He was sentenced to five years in prison in July 2014 on a violation of probation charge after being convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a concealed weapon in 2008, which he served three years for, a Department of Corrections spokesman said.

On  Wednesday night, the restaurant opened, less than 18 hours after the shooting, with a few small groups of people quietly dining inside the brightly painted eatery.

While those evening diners declined to talk to reporters, patrons who were at the restaurant in the early morning hours described a chaotic scene.

TJ Chapman normally travels for work but has Tallahassee ties. He decided to go to El Patron Tuesday night. Just before the gunfire started, Chapman stepped outside to smoke with a friend. He heard a few pops, followed by what he believed was police firing back at the suspect, before he, like many others, started to flee the restaurant.

""Being in there last night was crazy. It was super crowded. You couldn’t even move,"" said Chapman, who attended Florida A&M University in the early 90s but now is a manager for rap artist B.o.B.

""People in there, they’ve never seen people being shot directly in front of them with bodies lying on the ground in the place. It was just crazy.""

Chapman got into his car and left, not wanting to get caught up in the chaos with rest of the patrons leaving the restaurant.  As he looked through social media posts Wednesday morning, he felt lucky to have stepped outside when he did but also noted the painful messages he was seeing from others who were at the restaurant.

“It messed up a lot of people being in there and witnessing people being shot and killed,” he said. “I think last night really scarred a lot of people.”

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. | Tallahassee police say a suspect in a fatal shooting during a melee at a Mexican restaurant was killed by an off-duty officer.

In all, four people were shot during the altercation early Wednesday.

Police spokesman David Northway says two off-duty officers were providing security outside the restaurant when patrons alerted them to a fight inside that led to one customer being shot and killed.

Northway says the altercation then continued in the parking lot, where two more people were shot. One of the officers then shot the suspect, who died at a hospital.

The two injured people were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Northway says it isn't clear whether the suspect killed outside the restaurant is the same person who killed a customer inside.

YORK COUNTY, Va. (WAVY) — A dangerous fugitive with an extensive criminal history on the Peninsula is now dead. York-Poquoson Sheriff Danny Diggs said a deputy fatally shot the man when he pulled a loaded gun from his waistband during a confrontation Wednesday morning.

(WAVY/Lavoy Harrell)
(WAVY/Lavoy Harrell)
During a press conference, Diggs said the incident began around 6:30 a.m. when three deputies came upon the scene of a single-vehicle crash on Fort Eustis Boulevard. It appeared as though the vehicle had spun out of control. The deputies stopped to investigate and found a man about 200 yards from the car.

According to deputies, the man would not give them his real name. During the press conference, Diggs showed a deputy’s body-camera video that showed the deputy asking for the suspect’s name and the suspect giving the deputy several variations of the name.

About 15 minutes into the questioning, the video showed the suspect reaching into his waistband and pulling out a gun. At that point, the video showed the deputy firing about six shots.

Ivey later confirmed the suspect’s gun was found loaded with one bullet in the chamber, and the safety was off.


Deputies questioned another man on the scene about the accident, when they say he became uncooperative. Diggs said that man was Tazed and taken into custody. WAVY.com confirmed Thursday that man will not face charges pertaining to this incident.

No deputies were injured.

The suspect was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He has been identified as 26-year-old Damien A. Harrell, of Newport News.

At the time of his death, Harrell was wanted in Newport News for a list of charges. He also has a long history of criminal convictions, for which he served multiple jail sentences and was on active probation. Ivey said law enforcement considered him armed and dangerous with violent tendencies.

Most recently, Harrell was charged with failure to appear for a missed court appearance on June 1 for the following charges, stemming from an incident in October 2013:

possession of a firearm by a convicted felon
brandishing a firearm
grand larceny of a firearm
He was also wanted for unauthorized use of a vehicle, assault and failure to appear for an incident in May. There is also a permanent protective order that prohibited him from possessing a firearm.

Harrell was previously found guilty of a 2004 robbery, a 2005 robbery, unlawful wounding during a 2004 assault, and use of a firearm in commission of a 2004 felony and a 2005 felony. In total, Harrell was sentenced to 9 years in prison for those convictions.

The entire incident Wednesday morning was captured on the deputy’s body camera. In an effort to be transparent to the public, Sheriff Diggs showed that video to the media during Wednesday’s press conference. However, he did not give a copy of the video to the media and cannot make the video public because of the ongoing investigation, Ivey said.

The York-Poquoson Sheriff's Office said a deputy shot and killed Damien Harrell June 24, 2015 after Harrell pulled a gun on the deputy during an accident investigation.   (Photo: Newport News Police Department)

YORK COUNTY, Va. (WVEC) -- The York-Poquoson Sheriff's Office said 26-year-old Damien Harrell of Newport News was killed Wednesday by a deputy after Harrell pulled a gun on the deputy.

The deputy fired six times during the incident which started during an accident investigation.

The deadly shooting closed Fort Eustis Boulevard just as the morning rush began – around 6:30 a.m. – near Richneck Road.

A 13News Now viewer sent a picture of fire units and sheriff's deputies on the scene.

She wrote, ""I saw one officer comforting another officer.""

York-Poquoson Sheriff's Office spokesman Lieutenant Dennis Ivey said, ""The incident started as a vehicle accident investigation that ended up resulting in a confrontation with a suspect armed with a hand gun and a deputy sheriff. After the suspect produced a handgun on the deputy, the deputy shot him.""

At a late morning news conference, authorities said the body cam video shows the officer firing six times.

Harrell died at the hospital.

Ivey said the investigation revealed that Harrell was wanted on multiple charges in another locality and had an extensive criminal history.

On June 1 he was scheduled to appear in Newport News Circuit Court for an incident from October 21, 2013.

Charges related to that incident included Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, Brandishing a Firearm, Grand Larceny of a Firearm.

Harrell failed to appear in court June 1.

Ivey said Harrell also was wanted by Newport News Police for an incident on May 27, 2015.

Charges from that incident included Unauthorized Use of a Vehicle, Assault, Failure to Appear.

Harrell was under a Permanent Protective Order which prohibited him from possessing a firearm.

Other criminal history coming from Newport News:

Robbery, occuring December 14, 2004. Found guilty, July 28, 2006. Sentenced to 20 years, 19 suspended.

Robbery, occurring July 9, 2005. Found guilty, July 28, 2006. Sentenced to 10 years, 9 suspended.

Felonious Assault, occurring July 9, 2005. Found guilty, July 28, 2006 of Unlawful Wounding. Sentenced to 5 years, 4 suspended.

Use of a Firearm in the Commission of a Felony (2 counts), occurring December 14, 2004 and July 9, 2005. Found guilty, July 28, 2006. Sentenced to 3 years on each charge.

Harrell was on active probation.

""He's not biologically my son, but I treated him as mine,"" said Sherry Campbell who is engaged to Harrell's father and had known Harrell for about a year-and-a-half.

""I'm not gonna say everybody is good, everybody's bad. Everybody has their days, but that part of him, I don't know anything about. All I know is what he and I dealt with, and it was always smiles, jokes and laughs, you know, that's all that I know,"" Campbell told 13News Now. ""It's been rough. I mean, it's just tears everywhere.""

She added that Harrell was a proud uncle of a niece and nephew.

13News Now stopped by his mother's home in Newport News where an aunt said the day had been especially difficult for the family because Harrell's grandmother died on the same date six years ago.

No deputies were hurt during the shooting Wednesday.

WALNUT PARK - A foot chase of a suspect in unincorporated Walnut Park ended with his death in a deputy-involved shooting, authorities said today.

The suspect and a female passenger had been sought for avoiding a traffic stop when they crashed their stolen vehicle in an alley and fled the scene, said Los Angeles County sheriff’s Deputy Trina Schrader said.

Both suspects fled through yards in the neighborhood before the suspect was contacted in the 2400 block of Flower Street around 6:40 p.m. Thursday, Schrader said.

The shooting occurred when the suspect placed his hands in his waistband, Schrader said.

Witnesses to the crash had told deputies the suspect was armed, but Schrader said no weapon was found.

The suspect broke into two occupied residences and stole property as deputies searched for him, Schrader said.

The female passenger in the vehicle was taken into custody, Schrader said.",No,,,,,,http://homicide.latimes.com/post/antonio-perez-2015-01832/,"Antonio Perez, 32","Antonio Perez, a 32-year-old Latino, was fatally wounded by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy on Thursday, March 12, in the 2400 block of Flower Street in Walnut Park, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Deputies attempted to stop a vehicle that had been reported stolen about 6:30 p.m., but the vehicle sped away, according to a news release from the L.A. County Sheriff's Department.

Deputies lost sight of the vehicle but later found it had crashed in an alleyway. Two people -- described by authorities as a Latino and a Latina, ran away.

A department helicopter spotted the man and the woman running through yards in the area. The man, later identified as Perez, continued to run from deputies. ""When the deputies attempted to make contact again, the suspect turned on the deputies with his hands in his waistband,"" according to a statement from the department.

Perez was shot by a single deputy, said Lt. Dave Coleman. Perez was pronounced dead at the scene at 6:54 p.m., said Ed Winter, assistant chief of investigations for the coroner's office.

No weapon has been located. The woman was taken into custody.

Authorities later learned that as Perez was attempting to flee, he broke into two occupied homes and stole various items. No residents were injured.

A man who police said was acting up outside a high school graduation in Louisa died after being shocked twice with a Taser while fighting with police.

Kentucky State Police said in a news release that an autopsy was conducted Saturday on Billy J. Collins at the state medical examiner's office in Frankfort.

The final report is pending, but the preliminary investigation by state police does not indicate ""criminal actions involving any law enforcement officers,"" according to the news release.

Louisa police Sgt. Steven Wilburn was attending the Lawrence County High School graduation on Friday when he saw Collins, 56, of Louisa, drive off the road and into a ditch, where he got stuck, police said.

State police said Collins ""began acting in an inappropriate manner by yelling and cursing toward individuals attending the graduation ceremony.""

He was arrested on charges of driving on a suspended license, failure to maintain insurance and disorderly conduct.

When Collins got to the police department, state police said, he ""refused to comply with all officer commands"" and hit Wilburn ""multiple times"" before barricading himself in the foyer.

A member of the Lawrence County Sheriff's Department who responded to Wilburn's call for help deployed his Taser ""through a small crack in the door, striking Collins,"" according to state police. The Taser was not effective, and Collins removed the probes.

State police said Wilburn then came into the foyer through another door and, when Collins still refused to comply with his orders, he deployed his Taser on Collins again.

That time, ""the Taser was effective, but Collins continued to resist and would not comply with officer's commands,"" according to the news release.

The officers hit Collins with ""closed empty hands"" and batons, state police said

Once Collins was subdued, they restrained him and placed him ""in a seated position"" and called for emergency medical services, according to the news release.

Before EMS arrived, ""Collins began exhibiting signs of a medical emergency,"" state police said.

He was taken to Three Rivers Medical Center, where he died about 9:30 p.m.

State police said the investigation is continuing and that ""prior medical issues are being reviewed.""

LOUISA, Ky. -- A man died after a confrontation with officers who used a stun gun on him at a police department in eastern Kentucky, state police said.

Billy J. Collins, 56, became combative at the Louisa Police Department after his arrest Friday and struck Sgt. Steven Wilburn multiple times before fleeing into a foyer, where he barricaded himself, according to a Kentucky State Police statement.

Collins was hit twice with a stun gun but continued to be combative, the statement said. Officers had a physical confrontation with him that included ""strikes with closed empty hands"" and with agency-issued batons before bringing him under control, police said.

Collins was then restrained and put in a sitting position when he began showing signs of a medical emergency, police said. He was taken to a hospital, where he died.

Results of an autopsy weren't released, but police said they are reviewing Collins' prior medical issues as part of their investigation. The preliminary investigation has found no criminal activity on the part of officers, police said.

Louisa Police Chief Greg A. Fugitt said the department is cooperating fully with the state police investigation. He referred other questions about the case to Kentucky State Police.

A state police spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

According to CBS affiliate WYMT, police said the incident started when a police officer who was attending the Lawrence County High School graduation noticed a car, driven by Collins, drive off the road.

Collins allegedly began yelling and cursing at people at the graduation, the station reported, before he was arrested.

Long Beach police shot and killed a man they said stabbed six people.

Officers were called to an area near a convalescent home shortly before 8.30pm on Friday where they confronted the suspect and shot him to death, Sergeant Megan Zabel said. The suspect’s name was not immediately released by the department.

Five of the six people who were stabbed were taken to nearby hospitals and one person was treated and released at the scene, spokesman Brian Fisk of the Long Beach Fire Department said. The conditions of those taken to the hospitals ranged from critical to suffering from superficial wounds, Zabel said.

It was unclear whether the convalescent home was involved, Zabel said.

KNBC-TV reported that relatives of the suspected attacker arrived at the scene after learning he had been killed.

Second Suspet Dies After Shooting In Tempe




   
KNXVSHOW CAPTION
 








PHOENIX - A suspect wanted by police for a probation violation was shot and killed Wednesday after pulling out a gun in front of officers in Tempe, according to authorities.

A second man, who was with the suspect and caught in the crossfire, was also shot and taken to a local hospital where he died, police confirmed.

Officials said the U.S. Marshal Task Force initially tried to take Salvador Muna into custody on Tuesday, but were unsuccessful. On Wednesday, that task force went to a different location and found Muna.

Police said Muna hopped into a vehicle driven by his friend, Joaquin Hernandez, and fled eastbound on Baseline Road.

Witnesses said authorities conducted a maneuver to pin the suspects' vehicle near the 48th Street intersection.

Authorities said Muna pulled out a gun, pointed it at officers and that's when four officers, one from Tempe, one from Chandler and two from Mesa, opened fire. Witnesses reported hearing at least six shots. It is unclear at this time if Muna actually fired his weapon.

Police confirmed that Muna died at the scene. Authorities say Muna has various felony violations, including drug and weapons charges.

Hernandez was hurt in the crossfire and taken to a local hospital. He died a short time later.

Authorities said no officers were injured in the shooting.

Air15 video showed several vehicles, some appearing to be undercover police vehicles, crowded around several other vehicles near 48th Street and Baseline Road.

Police shot and killed a fugitive they were trying to arrest and the driver of the car he was in on Wednesday near a busy Tempe intersection, authorities said.

Officers had the vehicle pinned when the armed fugitive, whose name was not immediately released, refused to obey police commands, according to Lt. Scott Smith of Tempe police.

""It was during this maneuver that the suspect left the front passenger seat in an attempt to get to the back seat, where he raised a firearm and pointed it at officers who were giving him the command to give up,"" Smith said.

Smith said it wasn't clear who fired the first shot.

Police first shot the fugitive, later identified as 28-year-old Salvador Muna, of Tempe, and then targeted the driver when he made a movement that officers perceived as threatening, Smith said. Muna died at the scene, and the driver, whom police identified as 28-year-old Joaquin Hernandez, of Tempe, was pronounced dead at a hospital.

No officers were harmed during the incident near Baseline Road and 48th Street, authorities said.

Police say they tracked down Muna on Tuesday but were unable to take him into custody. U.S. Marshals put together a fugitive task force to arrest him on Wednesday, according to Lt. Scott Smith of Tempe police.

The Tempe, Mesa, and Chandler police departments all took part in trying to arrest Muna, who authorities said was wanted for a probation violation and had shown violent tendencies in the past.

""The suspect had prior law enforcement contact before, which involved crimes of violence, weapon violations and drug offenses,"" Smith said.

Muna's past convictions include aggravated DUI, misconduct involving a weapon and fleeing from police in 2010, according to Arizona Department of Corrections data. More recently, Muna was found guilty of a dangerous drug violation and driving with a suspended license in April 2014, according to court documents.


At about 3 p.m. Wednesday, the task force was attempting to trap Muna by blocking him into an intersection, Smith said.

It happened near the University of Advanced Technology, where students heard the gunshots and ran outside, Nick Friancia said.

""It was just crazy,"" said Friancia, a student at the school. ""I heard four to five gunshots. It felt like there was a firefight.""

 Denham Springs officer shoots, kills man near Bass Pro Shops after weapon brandished, police say _lowres

 Denham Springs police release name of officer in Monday fatal shooting _lowres
Advocate staff photo by PATRICK DENNIS -- Denham Springs Police investigate the scene where a man brandishing a pistol was shot once by a Denham Springs Police officer Monday afternoon. Police Chief Scott Jones said the man was ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon and was shot when the man did not comply.
DENHAM SPRINGS — A Denham Springs police officer on Monday shot and killed a Fort Worth, Texas, truck driver who was brandishing a gun, officials said.

The man was identified as Robert Kohl, 47, city Detective Glenn Lemoine confirmed.

Police were called to the area near the Bass Pro Shops shortly after 3 p.m. after a woman reported she was concerned for her son, who was threatening suicide, Lemoine said.

Police found Kohl wandering in a grassy area. Officers ordered him to show his hands, though he initially refused.

Eventually, Kohl pulled out a handgun and disobeyed orders to drop the weapon, Lemoine said. Kohl pointed the gun toward police and was shot once in the torso by an officer with a shotgun. The standoff lasted about 10 to 15 minutes, Lemoine said. About six officers were on scene when the shooting occurred, he said.

Kohl had been taken to Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center but later died, Lemoine said.

Police on Tuesday will identify the officer who shot Kohl. In the meantime, the officer, a veteran with about five years of experience on the force, has been placed on administrative leave, Lemoine said.

When asked if the shooting was an instance of “suicide by cop,” the detective said it was possible but stressed the investigation is still ongoing. The Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office has been called in to perform the investigation.

Lemoine said Kohl, a truck driver, had been stopped by authorities in Texas and ordered to pull over, as he had exceeded his driving hours. Investigators believe he left he area where he had been ordered to stay and continued driving into Louisiana, where he was pulled over by State Police around Denham Springs about 11:45 p.m. Sunday and again ordered to stop driving.

About 11:30 a.m. Monday, he contacted Livingston Parish dispatch and asked if he could leave. Officers told him he needed to follow whatever instructions the state gave him. Sometime between that call and the standoff, Kohl contacted his mother, who Lemoine said is believed to live in the Lafayette area.

“He was pretty upset,” the detective said.

Matt Cook was in the area to shop at Bass Pro and watched the standoff. He said he saw Kohl pull a gun, pointing it slightly up and sweeping it from right to left. Then he heard the shot and saw Kohl “fall like a sack of potatoes.”

He didn’t hear any words but confirmed he heard only a single shot.

“They did the right thing,” Cook said of police.

“They did everything right.”

Zach Clark, who works at the nearby Piccadilly, was on his break sitting outside and talking to his girlfriend on the phone when he heard a “boom.”

Hearing only one shot, he thought maybe Kohl had turned his gun on himself. He saw about six to eight police officers as well as the man.

Monday’s shooting is the second involving Livingston Parish law enforcement this month. On Feb. 3, an off-duty deputy was involved in a shootout with his girlfriend’s estranged husband, though authorities have determined the estranged husband died after shooting himself.

Advocate staff photo by PATRICK DENNIS -- Denham Springs Police investigate the scene where a man brandishing a pistol was shot once by a Denham Springs Police officer Monday afternoon. Police Chief Scott Jones said the man was ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon and was shot when the man did not comply.
A Denham Springs police officer was justified in fatally shooting a Texas truck driver who police say brandished a gun when officers responded to a report of a suicidal man last month, the Livingston Parish sheriff announced Friday.

Michael Brien LeBlanc, 30, shot 47-year-old Robert Kohl, of Fort Worth, Texas, after Kohl brandished a gun and pointed it toward officers near the Bass Pro Shops on Feb. 23, police have said.

Officers contacted Kohl after his mother called dispatch and said he was talking about killing himself. In a 911 recording released Friday, she says Kohl thought he had been fired, but that didn’t appear to be the case.

City and state police have said Kohl was ordered to pull off the highway the night before after exceeding his driving hours. He told a trooper at the time that he was being followed by law enforcement, but officers have said there wasn’t any police activity in the area that would have supported his claim.

“He was seeing things that weren’t there,” city Detective Glenn Lemoine said the week of the shooting.

Kohl also briefly spoke with a dispatcher shortly before he was shot. The call is difficult to follow and ends abruptly when Kohl hangs up.

He tells a dispatcher he is parked near the highway in Denham Springs and there is a “huge” number of police near him before any were dispatched.

“Wait, hold on. I’m lost. What? Start over,” the dispatcher responds.

“I’m sorry, I’m just really upset over what everyone’s doing,” Kohl says.

Sounding anxious, he says he was told to stop driving the night before and that he wants to move his truck and go to a hotel or go home, but he’s scared. Kohl says he isn’t sure how long he was supposed to rest and wants a straight answer and that he doesn’t want to be “chased again.”

The dispatcher repeatedly asks if Kohl feels fit to drive. Kohl says he can drive but that he doesn’t want to because there are people tailing him.

“Who’s following you? You’re not making any sense right now,” the dispatcher says.

“Please don’t do this to me. I can, I used to be a cop back in the 1990s. I know what. You know what? Forget it. I’m sorry to bother you,” Kohl responds.

The dispatcher begins to tell Kohl he isn’t bothering him, but Kohl hangs up.

“He was a good guy. ... Unfortunately he had suffered with mental health problems all of his life,” his sister Lara Kohl Burhenn said in a Friday phone interview, adding that she didn’t know his specific diagnosis.

“We weren’t there. We don’t know what happened that day. ... We will never know what was going on in his mind that day.”

In the 911 tapes, officers describe arriving on scene, and one remarks that Kohl has a weapon. A few minutes later, they say they’ve taken cover behind a concrete barrier about 30 feet away from him.

“He’s got a gun; he’s got a gun. We’re trying to talk to him,” someone says.

Thirty seconds later, “Shots fired, shots fired.”

Officers call for medics, but Kohl died in a hospital a few hours later from his wounds. He was hit once in the torso with a shotgun.

Burhenn said her family is still grieving Kohl’s death.

“This is a horrendous situation for us to deal with,” she said.

But she said she doesn’t blame the police.

“Our sympathy goes out to them. ... They had to face that decision,” Burhenn said. “We didn’t doubt that the officers had any misconduct there.”

The city asked the Sheriff’s Office to perform the criminal investigation of the shooting. While the case is still open, investigators have determined LeBlanc was justified in shooting Kohl.

“The officer was in fear of his life, as well as the life of a fellow Denham Springs officer on scene when confronted by Robert Kohl. Kohl’s actions toward these officers dictated the action taken,” Sheriff Jason Ard wrote in a news release.

Denham Springs Police Chief Scott Jones also said the department’s use of force board met Friday and found LeBlanc followed procedure. The chief added that the procedure will not be altered.

“(LeBlanc) acted accordingly and under Louisiana law in using deadly force,” he said.

Jones said the officer has been placed on light duty, such as performing office work. The department is waiting for the results of a psychological test before returning him to his regular duties.

WEATHERFORD – Police say they shot and killed a suspect Tuesday morning after the man refused to pull over, led officers on a chase, and ultimately forced his way into a patrol car where there was a duty weapon.

According to Weatherford Police Public Information Officer Chris Crawford, at 4:16 a.m., and officer with Weatherford PD attempted to pull over a tan SUV for running a stop sign on Ric Williamson Memorial Highway. The driver, later identified as a 41-year-old white male from Weatherford, refused to pull over and a chase began.

Officers chased the suspect onto eastbound Interstate 20 before he exited onto Bethel Road. He continued down Bethel Road, until at one point, the suspect slammed on his brakes, put his vehicle in reverse, and rammed into a pursuing patrol unit. He continued southbound down Bethel before finally losing control of the SUV and running off the road near the intersection of Bethel and Thompson roads, Crawford said.

Police say the suspect attempted to free his vehicle, but eventually gave up, exited the SUV, and began walking quickly toward the driver's side of the closest police vehicle while carrying a baby seat. The officers in the police unit had left the vehicle and positioned themselves on the passenger side for cover.

The suspect reached the driver's side door, ignoring commands to stop, threw the baby seat into the patrol vehicle and got in the driver's seat, where police say he was within arm's reach of a shotgun in the police car's gun rack.

Police said there was no baby in the car seat, however police did find the suspect's wife, a child, and another man in the wrecked-out SUV.

One of the officers shot several times through the passenger window of the vehicle, striking the suspect. Emergency medical responders were called to the scene as officers provided basic medical attention, Crawford said.

Medical personnel declared the suspect dead at the scene.

According to police, as they were investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident Tuesday, they learned of a gas leak at the suspect's rented home. So much gas had built up in the small home that authorities had to shut down all of Palo Pinto Street while they ventilated the location.

The suspect's identity has not been released as authorities attempt to contact his next of kin. A close acquaintance said the dead man is 41-year-old Michael Tindall. He had an active felony warrant for his arrest for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for a stabbing Saturday near the suspect's home in Weatherford.

The Texas Rangers will take lead on the investigation, as is the case in most officer-involved shootings.

The officer who fired on the suspect is a five-year Weatherford police veteran and he has been placed on administrative leave pending investigation.

WEATHERFORD (CBSDFW) – There was a deadly officer involved shooting in Weatherford early Tuesday morning.

According to Police, officers tried to pull over a vehicle for running a stop sign on Ric Williamson Memorial Hwy  around 4:00am.

After refusing to stop, the unidentified male driver gave chase, and at one point put his SUV into reverse and rammed into the a patrol car.

Reports say the suspect lost control of the SUV at Bethel Road and Thompson Road. With the vehicle stuck, the male suspect got out of the vehicle and walked towards the officer’s car – while carrying a baby seat in front of him.

The suspect allegedly ignored the officer’s commands to stop and kept walking towards the patrol car.

The suspect then threw the baby seat in the car and jumped into the running patrol car where there was a weapon within arm’s reach of the suspect. The officer then shot the man several times — killing him.

The suspect in this case is a Weatherford resident, W/M, 41 years of age.  The suspect’s identity is currently being withheld to allow for family notifications.

The Texas Rangers will take the lead on the investigation.

According to Weather PD, the officer has been placed on routine administrative leave.

The name of the man shot and killed by a Weatherford police officer after a car chase Tuesday was released Thursday.

Michael Tindall, 41, of Weatherford, died of gunshot wounds to the head and chest, according to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner’s office.

Tindall led police on a chase early Tuesday morning, with his wife, infant and roommate in a tan SUV, said Lt. Chris Crawford, a Weatherford police spokesman. Officers later found an intentionally torn gas line at Tindall’s home.

“We were absolutely shocked it didn’t explode,” Crawford told the Star-Telegram Wednesday.

The investigation into the shooting and the gas leak is still ongoing. The officer involved in the shooting remained on administrative leave Thursday, Crawford said.

Authorities towed cars and closed off streets near the scene where a carjacking suspect was killed after taking hostages at a restaurant Thursday night. Adrian Arambulo reports for NBC4 News Today in LA on Friday, Sept. 11, 2015. (Published Friday, Sept. 11, 2015)
An armed carjacking suspect was shot and killed by deputies who raided a crowded Downey barbecue restaurant where the man had taken hostages after a high-speed chase across Los Angeles, authorities said.
The suspect, who was not immediately identified, ran into Chris & Pitt's BBQ Restaurant at 9243 Lakewood Boulevard around 7:45 p.m., after the car he was driving crashed into another vehicle after police spun his car out, said Commander Michael Parker, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman.

The suspect could be seen apparently firing shots into the air with a handgun after he fled his vehicle and ran towards the restaurant.
After the man ran into the restaurant, people began running out. Police said the armed suspect kept about four of the patrons hostage while allowing others leave the restaurant.

After about an hour, SWAT members stormed the restaurant and fatally shot the man after he did not comply with their orders, police said.
Some patrons were put in handcuffs and were corralled by police while other officers surrounded the restaurant with guns drawn.

Parker said the patrons were put in handcuffs as a precaution because authorities were concerned the man would try to hide among the restaurant goers.
""We needed to confirm they weren't involved,"" Parker said. ""A lot of people came out, but we didn't know who was still in. This was a rapidly evolving event.""
The patrons were later escorted by officers into a nearby McDonald's restaurant to be interviewed by authorities.
The chase, which reached speeds around 80 mph, began in Downey and continued north on freeways and streets for about 45 minutes before the suspect returned to Downey.
""It was extraordinary,"" Parker said. ""You could tell by his driving that he had absolutely no concern for the public. He showed it between his driving a stolen car, carjacking a car at gunpoint, shooting his gun. This was a very dangerous night for law enforcement and the public.""
The pursuit began after a police helicopter got a hit on a stolen car -- a 1998 Honda Civic -- through LoJack, the vehicle tracking system, at 6:30 p.m. in Pico Rivera, Parker said.
The high-speed chase spanned several cities. The suspect ran several red lights and had several close calls with oncoming cars. The chase ended when a California Highway Patrol SUV spun his vehicle out, which forced his car to crash.
Police towed the suspect's vehicle and at least one police car as they continued to investigate the scene on Friday.
Authorities said they were continuing to investigate and gather information about the suspect's possible motives.

Deputies shot and killed a man with a gun after he burst into a crowded Downey barbecue restaurant Thursday, sending patrons and employees fleeing.

The standoff and deputy-involved shooting came to a conclusion after the suspect led police on a wild pursuit and firing a gun into the air, authorities said.

The pursuit began shortly before 7 p.m. in the Whittier area, according to Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials.

A sheriff’s helicopter flying over the jurisdiction of the sheriff’s Pico Rivera Station spotted a Honda Civic that had been reported stolen and was emanating a LoJack tracking signal, sheriff’s Cmdr. Mike Parker said.

“As patrol deputies from Pico (Rivera) station were headed to that location, the helicopter pilot and observer watched as the suspect carjacked a person at gunpoint,” Parker said.

The carjacking took place in unincorporated West Whittier.

Deputies as well as CHP officers chased the suspect as he fled along surface streets and freeway lanes through Montebello, Monterey Park, East Los Angeles, and Downey, Parker said. He was involved in at least one hit-and-run collision during the chase.

Pursuing officers used a PIT maneuver to bringing the chase to an end in the 9200 block on Lakewood Boulevard in Downey, officials said.

After crashing his car into another vehicle, the suspect fired a handgun into the air as he fled from his crashed car and ran into a nearby Chris’ & Pitt’s restaurant at 9243 Lakewood Blvd, Parker said.

Patrons and employees could be seen fleeing from the building as heavily armed deputies took positions around the restaurant. Sheriff’s officials could not confirm initial reports from the scene that the gunman had taken hostages.

“We don’t know if there’s any people inside with him,” Parker said.

Sheriff’s deputies, Downey police officers and CHP officials set up a “unified command” to handle the standoff, Parker said.

• Videos: Sheriff’s press conference, Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 | Part 4

A sheriff’s SWAT team, as well as a K-9 crisis negotiators were summoned to the scene.

“The Unified Command is seeking to convince the suspect to come out and surrender peacefully,” Parker said.

But the incident came to a violent end about 9 p.m., when a SWAT team entered the restaurant and engaged the suspect in gunfire, mortally wounding him, sheriff’s officials said.

A suspect was killed and a police officer was shot in the leg in a shootout in Northwest Baltimore.
A suspect was killed and a police officer was shot in the leg Wednesday night in a shootout in Northwest Baltimore, police said.

Officers were driving through the 3700 block of Oakmont Ave. about 7:45 p.m. when they saw the 32-year-old man with a gun, police said. They confronted him, and the gunman and at least one officer exchanged fire, police said.

Police did not name the gunman. Police said the officer, a five-year veteran of the department, was being treated at a hospital.

Police said they recovered the suspect's gun at the scene.

At least four orange cones — evidence markers — surrounded a white Dodge minivan about halfway down the block.

Detectives paced, investigating the scene.

Police spokesman T.J. Smith would not say whether the officers went to the block to arrest the suspect or were simply patrolling the neighborhood.

""We have officers that are dedicated to addressing the crime that we're seeing in our community daily, and these officers were a part of that team going after people — like this suspect — who have guns, that are on the street trying to harm communities,"" Smith said. ""This suspect produced that weapon and that's what led to this incident.""

Commissioner Kevin Davis and Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere were at the scene, Smith said. Davis and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake later went to the hospital to visit the wounded officer.

""First and foremost, we want to thank everybody for their thoughts and prayers,"" Smith said.

""Anytime you hear about a police officer being shot from this leadership position, it just makes your heart drop to your stomach,"" Davis said. ""Thankfully, he's going to be OK.""

Davis said the wounded officer's ""spirits are really high and he's surrounded by his squad"" at the hospital.

Davis also said he is ""proud of the work"" the officers were doing in the neighborhood when the incident occurred.

""They're out here doing some of the toughest police work we do,"" he said. ""They're out here engaging people who we know are harming our community.""

Baltimore police Director T.J. Smith said two officers in the 3700 block of Oakmont Avenue around 7:45 p.m. encountered a 32-year-old man armed with a gun. The man has been identified as Ryan Quinn Martin.

""The suspect was in the area on foot on the street. The officers were in the area. They encountered the suspect with a gun. The suspect fires that gun at the officers and shoots one of our officers. Fortunately, the officer's in stable condition. The officer, at least one at this point, returned fire, striking the suspect and the suspect is deceased,"" Smith said. ""A scary situation -- the worst call that we can get as a police department is that an officer has been shot.""

One of the officers was shot in the leg and was taken to Shock Trauma in fair condition. He has since been released from the hospital, officials said Monday.

The officer, identified as Thomas Young, was shot three times, once in the calf and two graze wounds in the thigh, police said. Young is a five-year veteran of the Baltimore Police Department.

Police Commissioner Kevin Davis stopped at the crime scene before going to the hospital, where he was joined by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.

""I just want him to know that his police commissioner cares about him, our leadership team cares about him. We ask these young police officers to go out here and do police work and to confront the people in our society who are harming us. It has been a tough year. Police officers put themselves in harm's way day in and day out,"" Davis said.

One of the officers was shot in the leg and was taken to Shock Trauma.
The other officer involved has been identified as Officer Duane Weston, a 10-year veteran of the force. He was not struck, police said.

A witness told 11 News that she heard multiple gunshots.

Loretta, who did not want to share her last name, referred to a police shoot out that unfolded right in front of her Oakmont Avenue home in Park Heights.

""They got guns, but they don't know how to shoot them. I guess it's just the Wild West, isn't nothing but the Wild West. I'm serious,"" Loretta said.

Smith said a weapon the suspect fired was recovered at the scene. The police spokesman said the officers were patrolling the area.

""Officers were in this area conducting crime initiatives. This is an area that we've asked our officers to be in to go after people that are harming the community,"" Smith said.

What provoked the shootout is still under investigation.

""He took out his gun and began firing it at the officers. The officers returned fire and struck Martin and Martin was pronounced deceased at a local hospital,"" Smith said.

Martin's criminal history dates back to 2002. Convictions include the illegal possession of a firearm, numerous drug charges not marijuana, drug manufacturing and he became the subject of a peace order to stay away from his employer.

Neighbors discuss the shooting so matter-of-fact on the street. They frequently hear gunfire, but usually a block or two away.

""All this senseless stuff going on, this is just senseless,"" Loretta said.

An autopsy will determine the number of gunshot wounds to Martin. Young is said to be in good spirits, but police said his recovery will be long.

Police said both plain-clothes officers, who are assigned to the Special Enforcement Unit, discharged their weapons in the incident.

Matthew Blakley: Deputy had worked at the sheriff's office since November.

An Aiken County sheriff’s deputy has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of his wife Saturday night, authorities say.
The victim was identified as Candace L. Blakley, 24, of North Augusta, according to a news release from Coroner Tim Carlton.
The suspect, Matthew Blak­ley, had worked at the Aiken County Sheriff’s Office since November and was off duty at the time of the shooting. He was enrolled at the South Carolina Criminal Jus­tice Academy and has been fired from the sheriff’s office, Capt. Nick Gallam said in a statement.
The shooting happened about 7:30 p.m. in the 1900 block of Coulter Drive in North Augusta, and the coroner's office was called to the scene about 30 minutes later.
Blakley was arrested early Sunday and is being held at the Aiken County De­­ten­­tion Center awaiting a bond hearing.
The South Carolina Law En­force­­ment Division was called to investigate because a deputy is the suspect, Carlton said.

NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (WRDW) -- The defense team for a former Aiken County Sheriff's Office employee charged involuntary manslaughter has waived his right to a preliminary hearing, according to the Aiken County Solicitor.

Matthew Blakely was arrested in June and charged with fatally shooting his wife, Candace Blakely.


News 12 @ 11 o'clock / Wednesday, June 17, 2015
NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (WRDW) -- An Aiken County deputy on paid leave, another one fired after what the sheriff's office says was an accidental shooting. Matthew Blakley was arrested on Sunday, charged with accidentally shooting and killing his wife, Candace Blakley. News 12 has been looking into the former deputy's short time on the job, and found at least one problem with weapons.
Amy Burgess can't believe her friend is gone. ""She was too young she was too beautiful she just started her career,"" she said.

Candace Blakley was more than just one of Amy's students, she was her friend. ""From the first day she was all smiles it didn't matter what she was going through she always had a smile on her face,"" Burgess said.

A smile she won't see again. On Saturday night Candace was shot and killed. The Aiken County Sheriff's Office arrested her husband, Matthew Blakley, saying he accidentally killed her. ""I just don't understand why this is happening to her,"" she said.

Matthew Blakley joined the Aiken County Sheriff's Office in November as a Road Deputy, he was still in the academy. But in those seven months, he's already been suspended and put on probation. His personnel file shows an incident in April where Blakley pulled out his gun while horse playing with another deputy.

His file also shows a history with weapons experience. Blakley lists four years with the Marine Corps as an infantry rifleman, as well as marksman qualifications for pistols and expert qualifications for rifles, the same type of weapon listed in the North Augusta incident report. ""The rest of her instructors, we just want to know why we just want to know why this happened,"" Burgess said.

The Aiken County Sheriff's Office tells News 12 they had never been called to the Blakley house before. Now questions over what exactly happened here are still being investigated. ""She was just overall a sweet precious person. I wouldn't wish this on one thousand enemies I can't even fathom what her family is going through right now,"" Burgess said.

Blakley was fired from the Aiken County Sheriff's Office after being arrested on Sunday. The other deputy in the house at the time, Matthew Murphy is on paid leave. He returns to work on Friday. We called SLED for an update on this investigation, and we'll let you know what they have to say.

UPDATE: Wednesday, June 17, 2015

NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (WRDW) -- A News 12 investigation finds that a former deputy charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of his wife had a prior disciplinary problem with guns by the Aiken County Sheriff's Office in April.

According to a corrective action report filed by the Aiken County Sheriff's Office, Matthew Blakley was suspended for one day and put on six months probation after he was seen with his firearm out of the holster in an attempt to horseplay with another deputy.

Investigators questioned Blakley after the incident where he admitted to the actions. This comes just two months before Blakley's wife, Candace was found dead in their bathroom believed to be accidentally shot on Saturday.

A note at the bottom of the April report noted that Blakley's performance would be closely monitored after the incident. Blakley was terminated Sunday.


UPDATE: Tuesday, June 16, 2015
NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (WRDW) -- The Aiken County Sheriff's Office says Matthew Murphy will return to work Friday after being put on paid leave after deadly shooting involving former deputy Matthew Blakley.

North Augusta Public Safety officers say Murphy was also in the home at the time former Aiken County deputy Matthew Blakley is accused of shooting and killing his wife, Candace Blakley. Investigators say Murphy had blood and cuts on his hands when they arrived at the scene.

NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (WRDW) -- Friends and neighbors are still in disbelief over Saturday nights shooting on Coulter Drive.

Off duty Aiken County Deputy Matthew Blakley is accused of shooting his wife, Candace, in their home. Blakley has been charged with involuntary manslaughter at this time.

The incident still has friends like Joeann Bell, who went to cosmetology school with Candace, could not believe the news when they heard it.

""I just started crying, just like I still can't wrap my head around it. It was like no,"" said Bell.

Bell said she did not know Matthew Blakley well, but knew that Candace cared about him and that they seemed like a happy couple.

""I knew that he was in the military and she was like all the time worried about him,"" said Bell, ""They seemed very happy and everything.""

Some neighbors were equally as shocked like Wendy Rogers, who lives down the street from the Blakley's.

""I was like what? I couldn't believe it. I was flabbergasted. I couldn't understand why,"" said Rogers.

Rogers says that the neighborhood has always been quite and that something happening like this is a major surprise.

""Absolutely because we've never ever had any trouble. It's always been really nice,"" said Rogers.

Friends like Bell say that there was never any signs of discontent between the couple, especially on their Facebook pages.

""They were always happy even on Facebook,"" said Bell, ""Always posting great pictures they were always smiling just they were always together just no we never thought there was ever anything wrong going on.""

SLED continues with the investigation, while those around the couple are left in disbelief.


Monday, June 15, 2015
NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (WRDW) -- North Augusta Public Safety has released the incident report of the shooting of Candace Blakley, 24. Her husband and now former Aiken County deputy Matthew Blakley, 23 is charged with involuntary manslaughter in her death.

According to Aiken County Coroner Tim Carlton, an autopsy report revealed Candace died from a gunshot wound to the head.

Officers reported when they responded to a call about a shooting on Coulter Drive Saturday around 7:30pm suspect deputy Blakley came running towards them with blood on his hands.

The incident report also says when officers approached the home deputy Blakley claimed the shooting was an accident and that his wife needed help. Deputy Blakley was arrested for involuntary manslaughter.

Officers say another man, Matthew Murphy, was also in the home at the time and had blood and cuts on his hands.

Officers say Murphy told them the victim was in the bathroom with a gunshot wound to the head. Deputies reported they found Candace in the bathtub deceased with a M4 rifle in the bathroom and a broken wedding band.

After a search of the home several other firearms were found around the home. SLED Crime Units are currently still investigating the shooting.

Matthew Blakley has since been terminated from his job with the Aiken County Sheriff's Office.


Sunday, June 14, 2015
NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (WRDW) -- Neighbors said it's a quiet neighborhood in North Augusta.

""Nothing ever happens in this neighborhood, you know the police live here and it's North Augusta,"" one neighbor said.

But after last night, people are not so sure. That's why this man didn't want to show his face, but it's filled with shock after hearing about a shooting, just across the street.

""To hear there was a shooting in the neighborhood is really strange, you wouldn't think something like that would happen here,"" he said.

Around eight o'clock Saturday night, deputies found Candace Blakley dead. The coroner said from a gunshot wound. Her husband Matthew Blakley is accused of killing her.

Neighbors who knew the couple said it's a sensitive subject, too sensitive to talk about. Friends of the couple said they were high school sweet hearts and both Candace and Matthew were great people. Candace was a hair dresser, Matthew was an Aiken County Deputy, and Facebook shows a former marine. Sunday morning, he was terminated by the Sheriff's Office when he was arrested for involuntary manslaughter. He joined the sheriff's office in November. He was currently attending the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy.

""Yeah I see him all the time, I see him when I go to work he's out in his yard washing his car, when you told me what happened I was really shocked,"" a neighbor said. ""I never heard any commotion up there like fighting or yelling or anything like that.""

And questions over what happened last night still linger.

""I'm hoping it was an accident, someone was cleaning the gun or had the gun and didn't know what they were doing it's a terrible thing,"" he said.

SLED is over the investigation.

CHARLESTON, S.C., June 15 (Reuters) - A South Carolina sheriff’s deputy has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of his wife, authorities said on Monday.

Matthew Jordan Blakley shot his wife, Candace Blakley, 24, with a rifle in their North Augusta home on Saturday evening, according to a police affidavit.

Blakley was fired from his job after he was arrested on Sunday, Aiken County Sheriff’s spokesman Captain Eric Abdullah said. Blakley had been with the sheriff’s office since November 2014, Abdullah said. Blakley was born in 1991 but a police report redacted his birth date.

When police arrived at the home on Saturday night, Blakley ran out of the house with blood on his hands and told officers he had accidentally shot his wife and she needed help, according to an incident report.

When the responding officers entered the house, another deputy, Matthew Murphy, who also had blood on his hands, told them the victim was in the bathroom with a gunshot wound to her head and that she was dead, the report said.

Murphy told police he had tried to save her with chest compressions, according to the report. Abdullah said Murphy had witnessed the shooting. Murphy has not been charged in the case.

Police found Candace Blakley in the bathtub with a gunshot wound to the head, the report said.

A rifle was also in the bathroom, and police found a spent shell casing and a broken wedding band on the bathroom floor. Police found several more weapons in the house, the report said.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is investigating the shooting.

Ocala police Officer Jared Forsyth, 33, died last week after a fellow officer accidentally shot him during a weekly firearms training exercise, investigators said. The unidentified officer was cleaning his gun when it accidentally discharged, ricocheted off of a bench and hit Forsyth, police said.

On Monday, funeral services were held at First Baptist Church of Ocala, at 2801 S.E. Maricamp Road.

""You can say you're going to be a little better, a better son, a little bit better husband, a better father, a better cop. You can say that in Jared's memory, even though you know you can't be perfect,"" Forsyth's father, Tim Haley, said. ""You see, that's the key. In the end of your life, if you were just a smidgeon better because of knowing Jared, then his death gave meaning to your life.""

Forsyth came from a long line of public servants, right down to his dad, who retired 30 days ago as battalion chief of the Pasco County Fire Department.

""Early on, he had said he would be a policeman or a fireman. He decided to go into law enforcement,"" Haley said.

Forsyth graduated from the academy in late 2011 and was hired by Ocala in 2012.

“We are very blessed to have had Officer Jared Forsyth as a member of our family, and we will long honor and cherish his memory,” Ocala police Chief Greg Graham said.

Graham spoke of the officer whose gun went off and how people need to remember him as well.

“He is hurting so deeply. We love him, too, and pray for his family as well,” Graham said.

Forsyth was remembered as a happy officer who always had positive thoughts.

“Never saw him angry. Never saw him mad, even in the toughest of situations,” said Officer James Yanok.

The Ocala Police Department on Wednesday identified Anthony Reghetti, a 14-year veteran, as the other officer involved in the accidental shooting that killed OPD Officer Jared Forsyth.

By Staff report
The Ocala Police Department on Wednesday identified Anthony Reghetti, a 14-year veteran, as the other officer involved in the accidental shooting that killed OPD Officer Jared Forsyth.

“We here at the Ocala Police Department are heartbroken over the pain and suffering Officer Reghetti is experiencing over this accident. He remains in our hearts and prayers as he goes through this, and we continue to stand by his side,” Chief Greg Graham said in a news release.

On April 6, Reghetti and Forsyth were taking part in firearms training at the Lowell Correctional Institution. The shooting happened in an area where weapons are cleaned.

According to official accounts, Reghetti’s .40-caliber Glock discharged and a bullet ricocheted through Forsyth’s arm and into his chest. Forsyth’s bulletproof vest didn’t protect him because the sides are not covered with bullet-resistant material.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement continues to investigate. Reghetti was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting but returned to work this week, assigned to administrative duties, in keeping with OPD standard procedure.

In the news release, Graham quotes words that Forsyth’s father addressed to members of the police department.

“We must not lose two brothers to the same accident when we still have one,” Timothy Haley Sr. is quoted as saying.

“Let’s not judge him. Let’s not look away. Hug him (Reghetti) like Jared would and tell him we are all family and we are here for him if he needs anything at all.”",Yes,Yes,NA,Yes,NA,NONE,Yes,http://www.ocala.com/news/20150724/no-charges-against-opd-officer-who-accidentally-shot-officer-jared-forsyth,No charges against OPD officer who accidentally shot Officer Jared Forsyth,"No charges against OPD officer who accidentally shot Officer Jared Forsyth

""It's time for us to find some peace. I know he didn't do it on purpose. It was just an accident,"" said Forsyth's mother, Amy Forsyth-Juliano, on Friday.

By Austin L. MillerStaff writer
Ocala Police Department Officer Jared Forsyth died on April 6, 2015, during training.  — File
OCALA – Prosecutors have reviewed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement report regarding the shooting death of an Ocala Police Department officer several months ago and have declined to file any charges.

Chief Assistant State Attorney Ric Ridgway, author of the two-page memorandum outlining his reasons for not pursuing any charges, said he met with officer Jared Forsyth’s mother and stepfather at their request and “they conveyed to me their strong feeling that prosecution was not appropriate,” according to his report.

“It’s time for us to find some peace. I know he didn’t do it on purpose. It was just an accident,” said Forsyth’s mother, Amy Forsyth-Juliano, on Friday.

During a weapon clearing activity following firearms training at Lowell Correctional Institution on April 6, Forsyth was shot by fellow officer Anthony Reghetti, who also was in training. Forsyth was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced deceased.

Police Chief Greg Graham turned the investigation over to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. FDLE turned their findings over to the State Attorney’s Office.

Ridgway noted that the scene was processed, physical evidence was collected and FDLE provided technical information about the operation of the firearm, a Glock .40-caliber semi-automatic pistol, issued by OPD.

Forsyth and Reghetti had finished their training and returned to a covered area. Forsyth was leaning over one of the cleaning stations and Reghetti was in a cleaning station about 13 feet away. Reghetti’s gun fired and the bullet struck the surface of the cleaning station, deflected upward and hit Forsyth on his right side. Forsyth was facing forward with his right side turned toward Reghetti. The bullet entered Forsyth’s body on his right side, between the front and back panels of his bullet-proof vest, the report states.

Reghetti dropped the gun, which remained on the ground until FDLE arrived. A magazine was inserted and the slide was pulled back. A single round was left in the chamber “since the slide locks back when the last round is fired,” the veteran prosecutor noted in his report.

Reghetti made several of what were described as spontaneous statements after the gun fired, such as, “I am sure I cleared it, I dropped the magazine. I was pushing down on the two levers. I dropped the slide and the gun went off,” the report states.

One person heard Reghetti say he took the magazine out of his firearm, racked it back, which caused a round to fall out, then pulled on slide lock tabs to release the slide, at which time he pulled the trigger to allow the slide to release and the gun discharged, the report states.

Ridgway said before he could explain the sequence of events, he had to demonstrate how a Glock pistol is disassembled for cleaning. First, he said, make sure the firearm is not loaded. This is done by releasing the magazine, allowing it to fall from the magazine well, then “fully retracting the slide to eject any live round that may be in the chamber,” according to the report. He added, “this allows both a visual and tactile inspection of the chamber. After this inspection, the slide is returned to its normal position.”

To remove the slide, Ridgway said, two steps must be completed. First, the slide stop must be “disengaged, which is done by depressing two tabs on the side of the frame after slightly retracting the slide.” Second, the trigger must be pulled “to disengage the trigger mechanism, which is contained in the frame, from the striker mechanism, which is contained in the slide.”

The two steps can be done in either order to release the slide from the frame, and once the slide is removed from the frame, the remainder of the firearm is then disassembled, the report notes.

“It is obvious the firearm was not properly cleared when Officer Reghetti began preparing the gun for cleaning. Based upon his statement, it appears he had depressed the slide lock tabs, then pulled the trigger to complete the removal of the slide. This caused the live round in the chamber to be discharged. At the time the firearm discharged it was being held in such a fashion that the muzzle was pointed in the general direction of, but not directly at, Officer Forsyth,” Ridgway wrote in the report.

“There is no evidence whatsoever that Officer Reghetti intended to cause the firearm to discharge. Likewise, it is clear that the fact he failed to properly clear the firearm before beginning to disassemble it was not an intentional act. The failure to properly clear it was an oversight,” Ridgway said.

From the findings, Ridgway said, criminal prosecution would be allowable “only if this oversight amounted to culpable negligence.”

The state recognizes three types of negligence: simple negligence, gross negligence and culpable negligence.

Reviewing each one, the prosecutor could not find one that fit the shooting, he said.

“The fact that Officer Reghetti forgot to properly clear the firearm before beginning to disassemble it does not come close to meeting this standard, and therefore, no crime occurred,” Ridgway said.

Ridgway concluded by saying, “this shooting was an accident, not a crime. Accordingly, this office will take no further action in the matter.”

Graham said he has spoken to the fallen officer’s parents and they are satisfied with the outcome. He thanked the FDLE and State Attorney’s Office for their thorough investigations.

Graham said his agency will proceed with an internal investigation to see if any policy or conduct rules were broken and he will invite the FDLE training division to review their policies and address any issues or concerns.

Reghetti, who returned to work about two weeks after the incident, could not be reached Friday for comment.

Frederick Boise, 18
An 18-year-old Dallas man suspected of shooting a security guard during an attempted robbery is in custody, according to police records.

Police say Frederick Boise, who also goes by Aaron James Stanley, shot a uniformed guard in the chest multiple times July 16 at the Minyard Food Store in the 2100 block of Singleton Boulevard in West Dallas.

According to police documents, Boise pulled out a 9mm handgun and demanded money from the store’s assistant manager. Police say Boise grazed the assistant manager when he shot at him and struck the guard. Two others were wounded. The security guard fired back and Boise fled on foot, according to police documents.

The next day, detectives received information from Grand Prairie police that a man had been dropped off at a hospital with a gunshot wound to the chest. Detectives determined the man was Boise, police documents state.

Boise told detectives July 20 that he was under the influence of drugs when he pointed his gun at some people and was shot by the guard before fleeing, according to the affidavit.

Boise is being held in the Dallas County jail on $165,000 bond. He has been charged with aggravated assault against a public servant and aggravated robbery.

Records show Boise also has holds from the Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office for eluding a police officer, robbery with a firearm, leaving the scene of a collision involving property damage, feloniously pointing a firearm, possession of a stolen vehicle and petit larceny.",Yes,No,,No,,http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/07/BOISE-FREDERICK-239x300.jpg,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20150210-man-killed-by-dallas-officer-was-fed-up-with-neighborhood-crime.ece,"Man killed by Dallas officer was fed up with repeated burglaries, neighbors say","Man killed by Dallas officer was fed up with repeated burglaries, neighbors say

Desmond Luster Sr.’s house had been burglarized several times — including Monday, the day Luster was killed by an officer after police say he sped toward the officer in a pickup.

Off-duty Dallas police officer fatally shoots man driving pickup
Desmond Luster Sr. was no criminal — in fact, he was fed up with crime.

“He was ranting and raving because he was tired of people breaking into his house and getting away with it,” said one neighbor, who asked not to be identified for fear that she would be targeted by burglars herself.

She said that on Monday afternoon — after two recent break-ins — Luster, 45, “must’ve just snapped.” Luster got in his pickup and chased people who he believed had broken into his home. He instead wound up shot to death by a police officer. The officer told dispatchers that Luster told him he was trying to run down the suspects.

Luster’s friends, neighbors and former co-workers said they were stunned by the uncharacteristic behavior Monday of a man they described as a calm, humorous family man who had grown increasingly concerned with crime in his neighborhood in recent years.

“He was fiercely loyal when his family was concerned,” said a longtime friend, Dwayne Traylor.

Luster reported to police Friday night that someone had kicked in his back door around 10:30 p.m. in the 6700 block of Shadow Creek Drive in southeast Oak Cliff. He visited a neighbor to ask if she heard anything — she heard a loud boom — and he complained that the thief had “cleaned out” his 17-year-old son’s room.

He also told her he was angry because his house had been broken into previously and he felt the police response was slow and inadequate, said the neighbor. The neighborhood has been plagued by a rash of burglaries, records show.

Police records show eight burglaries, two thefts and two reports of criminal mischief or vandalism in the last year at homes on Luster's quarter-mile-long street.

Luster’s neighbor said he had complained of about three break-ins prior to the one Monday. Police records show at least two other 911 calls from Luster’s house in recent years. He was listed as a victim of criminal mischief in June 2014. The report shows his garage door sustained about $200 of damage.

“He had mentioned to me that some of the neighborhoods in Dallas were not what they used to be ... more crime,” said Anthony Henderson, 45, who now lives in Cincinnati and knew Luster and Luster’s wife since they were all students at the University of North Texas.

Witnesses said frustration over that rising crime forced him to take matters into his own hands Monday. Police say that about 1:30 p.m., Luster fired shots and jumped a curb in the 7400 block of Bonnie View Road in his blue Dodge pickup while chasing juveniles who were running from his home.

Officer Aaron Tolerton, a six-year veteran who was working off-duty security at Flying J truck stop, went to investigate the reported gunfire and saw a teen running, police said. The officer arrested the teen and then saw a blue Dodge pickup speeding toward them off the road. Tolerton fired repeatedly into the truck, striking Luster.

The officer noted in a recorded exchange with a dispatcher that someone was wounded. Then, with information he apparently received from the mortally wounded Luster, he explained what happened.

“He’s telling me the two males that ran off were breaking into his [house] and he tried to ram them and me,” Tolerton said.

The officer has been placed on routine administrative leave. He has not yet given a statement to investigators, but will probably do so later this week, according to department policy.

The dead man’s mother, Beverly Luster-Brown, told KDFW-TV (Channel 4) on Tuesday that she made the 911 call Monday after Luster called her and told her someone had broken into his house. She said she told the 911 operator that her son was a process server and was authorized to carry a weapon and that he had fired it while chasing the thieves.

Luster was described as an “active shooter” over police radio. “That active shooter, he’s gonna be wearing a black shirt, blue jeans, jumping into a black pickup truck,” a dispatcher said.

Luster had no record of criminal history. In 2006, he was embroiled in a cheating scandal at Dallas Fire-Rescue. Investigators accused an instructor of helping Luster, who did poorly in his recruit class, cheat on the final exam, in which he scored at the top of his class. Luster resigned under investigation.

He had a son who starred at football at Skyline High School. Desmond Luster Jr., accepted a scholarship last week to play at Southeastern Oklahoma State University.

For about seven years, the elder Luster worked as a delivery driver for Oak Farms Dairy. He left late last year, former co-workers said.

Stephanie Sanders, an Oak Farms employee who worked with Luster, said Tuesday that she was shocked by the news of his death.

“The guy I always saw at work was always smiling, laughing and joking around,” she said. “I don’t even see him being aggressive or carrying a gun. I guess if your home’s been broken into that many times, you have to take some type of action.”",Yes,Yes,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20150210-luster.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w130h200/Luster.jpg,Yes,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20150210-luster.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w130h200/Luster.jpg,http://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/headlines/20150210-copshootingfolo_0210metlede.jpg.ece/BINARY/w940/copshootingfolo_0210metLEDE.jpg,Yes,http://www.fox4news.com/news/913559-story,Man shot dead by Dallas PD allegedly mislabeled by dispatchers as suspect,"Man shot dead by Dallas PD allegedly mislabeled by dispatchers as suspect

The mother of a man shot and killed Monday by Dallas police wants to know what happened.

The mother of a man shot and killed Monday by Dallas police wants to know what happened.

She says if what she's been told by police is right, something went terribly wrong Monday that may have made the officer who shot Desmond Luster, Sr. think he was one of the suspects they were looking for.

Luster worked two jobs -- one as a process server for a local law firm, and his mom says he was licensed to carry a gun.

At night, he stocked concession stands at Dallas ISD stadiums. 

Luster's mom, Beverly Luster-Brown, says his home was broken into twice within the last two days – the first time being Friday night, and again Monday.

Luster was at his mother's house Monday when he learned of the second break-in, and raced home in his blue Dodge pickup -- the same one shot up by an off-duty officer working at the Flying J. 

His brother was behind him in a black Dodge truck. 

Luster called his mother, saying he spotted three people running from his house. He drove through the power line easement behind his home to confront them.

""When they refused to stop and was still coming, he fired. He said, ‘Mama, I fired,"" said Luster-Brown.

That's when Luster-Brown says she called 911.

""I explained that he was a process server and that he did carry a gun because he delivers warrants,"" said Luster-Brown.

She gave dispatch descriptions of her son's truck, and she went to her son's home in the neighborhood behind the Flying J truck stop.

""I'm at his house at this time,"" said Luster-Brown.

""With officers at the house?"" asked FOX 4's Shaun Rabb.

""With the officers at the house,"" said Luster-Brown.

""And you're asking  911 at the same time, ‘Where is my son?'"" said Rabb.

""I'm steady asking them, ‘Do you all have any word? Have they found them?'"" said Luster-Brown.

By that time, the shooting had already happened just blocks away on Bonnie View Lane.

It was between 4:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. when Luster-Brown says a detective went to the home and told the family there was bad news -- there was a confrontation at the Flying J and an off-duty officer apprehended a suspect.

""Your son came up on the lot and jumped the curb. [The officer] feared for his life so he just opened fire,"" said Luster-Brown. 

Luster-Brown says the detective told her the off-duty officer was distraught.

""And then detectives also said, ‘Well, he's very remorseful but the problem is the report that came from the 911 call said the suspects were driving the Ram trucks,"" said Luster-Brown. ""I said, ‘That's an absolute lie because I spoke with the 911 operator personally.'""

That would have been critical information transmitted over police radios, and if that's correct, the officer would have thought the suspect was in that vehicle reportedly headed toward him at a high rate of speed.

Luster-Brown wonders how to explain this to Luster's two children.

""That's hard for a child,"" said Luster-Brown. ""It's hard for me and I'm not a child. I'm hurt and I'm angry and I'm trying to understand.""
The officer involved in the shooting, Aaron Tolerton, has been placed on administrative leave, per departmental policy. He has been with the Dallas Police Department for six years.

An autopsy found that a man shot and killed by a deputy Wednesday near Elkton, Maryland, died of a single gunshot wound to the head, state police said late Thursday.

""A large amount of heroin"" was found in his SUV after his death, said Sgt. Marc Black, spokesman for Maryland State Police headquarters in Pikesville.

Terry Garnett Jr., 37, of the 200 block of Locust Lane, Elkton, was shot about 12:20 p.m. after he refused to pull over for a traffic stop on Augustine Herman Highway (Md. 213) near Elkton, turned around on a side road and accelerated toward the deputy, Black said.

Garnett's SUV rolled through the backyard of a nearby home, where it hit a tree before stopping, Black said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.


Investigators obtained a warrant, searched Garnett's SUV and found heroin with ""an approximate $3,000 street value,"" Black told The News Journal in an interview. He did not disclose the total weight of the drug or how it was was packaged.

Heroin.net says single doses currently sell for $10 to $25. Using that website's cost figures, a quantity worth $3,000 on the street would range from 120 to 300 doses, typically packaged in small plastic bags for sale.

The ongoing investigation also found Thursday that Garnett had three outstanding warrants, all related to illegal drugs, Black said.

One, from the state police barrack at North East, Maryland, was for failure to appear on a drug charge, he said.

Another was a bench warrant from the Elkton Police Department relating to drug charges, he said.

The third was from Delaware Superior Court on a charge of controlled substance possession with intent to distribute, Black said.

Evidence technicians were continuing to process Garnett's SUV on Thursday, he said. No weapons have been found in the vehicle, he said.

The Cecil County Sheriff's office on Thursday identified the officer who shot Garnett as Deputy First Class Joseph Costa, a 6-year member of the Cecil County Sheriff's Office and assigned to the Sheriff's Office Street Level Crimes Unit.

State police said that, as Garnett's SUV accelerated toward Costa, ""fearing for his life, the deputy pulled his department-issued .40 caliber Glock pistol and shot multiple times at the vehicle.""

As expected, Garnett's death was ruled a homicide.

Although the autopsy – finished Thursday at the Office of the State Medical Examiner in Baltimore – found only one wound, state police have declined to say how many times Costa fired at him.

""That's part of the ongoing investigation,"" Black said.

The Maryland State Police Homicide Unit, which investigates all shootings involving state troopers and those involving other officers at their departments' request, is handling the investigation of Garnett's shooting at the request of Cecil County Sheriff Scott Adams ""to maintain impartiality,"" Black said.

Following standard policy, Adams placed Costa on routine administrative leave pending the outcome of the incident investigation. The sheriff's office is conducting its own an internal investigation.

ELKTON, Md. (WJZ) — A pursuit, a crash and a fatal shooting. The chaotic scene unfolds on a rural road in Cecil County after an attempted traffic stop quickly turns deadly.

Christie Ileto speaks with the driver’s family, who says he didn’t deserve to die.

Police have identified the suspect as Terry Garnett Jr. The driver refused to stop when officers tried to pull him over. His family tells WJZ regardless of what happened, he didn’t deserve to be shot multiple times.

Chaos unfolds on a quiet neighborhood street moments after a brief police pursuit. Evidence markers outline where police say Wednesday’s traffic stop turned deadly.


“His daughter called us and let us know that the police was chasing him and they ended up shooting him,” said Sheila Garnett, suspect’s stepmother.

Police say the suspect is 37-year-old Terry Garnett Jr.

“Sheriff deputy attempted to make a stop on a vehicle–the Mercury Mountaineer–the vehicle refused to stop,” said Sgt. Marc Black, Maryland State Police.

Police say the suspect was driving on Route 213 when a sheriff’s deputy tried to pull him over. He pulled into Lewis Shore Road, but when he turned around–that’s when the traffic stop turned deadly.

“Accelerating. Came back in a direction of the deputy. The deputy took his firearm out and discharged multiple rounds,” said Sgt. Black.

The SUV Garnett was driving hit a tree. He died at the scene.

“You don’t have to shoot nobody four times to stop them when they’re still in the car,” said Terry Garnett, suspect’s father.

Garnett’s family tries to make sense of the scene.

Police haven’t confirmed how many shots were fired and wouldn’t disclose why Garnett was being pulled over.

“I have lost a good son. And I’m not condoning what he does or what he did, but still, he don’t deserve to get shot like that,” his father said.

More answers than questions for an investigation that’s just starting.

NEW CITY - A man who was killed in a police standoff reached out during the ordeal to News 12 reporter Tara Rosenblum.

The standoff started around 7 p.m. yesterday in New City when a man barricaded himself inside his home and shot at police.

Just before 10:30 p.m., the suspect, who identified himself as Vincent Cordaro, called News 12 and spoke to Rosenblum. She says that while his voice was calm, his message was chilling. When Cordaro first called he said, ""I got a big story. It's going to be biblical. I've got police surrounding my home.""

In a later phone call, he described himself as a non-violent person. When asked about the source of all that frustration he was feeling toward police, Cordaro said ""What's going on? It's all about a crooked cop and the way Clarkstown police handle themselves.""

Cordaro abruptly ended the phone call and said he had to speak to the negotiators.

Around 2:30 a.m., after another round of gunfire, police entered the house and found Cordaro dead. In a news conference today, Clarkstown Police Chief Michael Sullivan says a single shot fired by an officer killed Cordero.

Sullivan added that claims by Cordaro about a crooked Clarkstown officer were ""irrational"" and the result of Cordaro's arrest last year for DWI.

Aside from two DWI arrests, Cordaro had two prior burglary arrests and his marriage had ended.",Yes,Yes,NA,No,,NONE,http://patch.com/new-york/newcity/no-charges-against-officer-feb-8-little-tor-shoot-out,No Charges Against Officer in Feb. 8 Little Tor Shoot-out,"No Charges Against Officer in Feb. 8 Little Tor Shoot-out

No Charges Against Officer in Feb. 8 Little Tor Shoot-out
A Rockland County Grand Jury declined to hand down any charges against the Clarkstown officer who shot and killed Vincent Cordaro Feb. 8 during an hours-long armed confrontation with police.

Rockland District Attorney Thomas Zugibe issued a statement summarizing what his office learned while investigating the shooting. The investigation was conducted outside the grand jury and therefore not bound by law to be secret.

According to that report, Cordaro suffered from depression and alcohol abuse, had been convicted several times in Clarkstown Town Court of offenses from drunk driving to menacing. He had also interacted with Clarkstown police during domestic disputes and suicide attempts.

“In assessing the evidence in this case it became clear that the unfortunate events that unfolded on the night of February 8, 2015 were undoubtedly triggered by the combined effect of Vincent Cordaro’s depression, his alcohol abuse and his desire to take his own life,” Zugibe said in the statement. “The loss of his life is tragic and highlights the continuing need to improve access to mental health services within our community.”

As the DA’s office reconstructed it, the evening of Feb. 8, Cordaro threatened family members with a shotgun and then barricaded himself inside his home on Little Tor Road, warning he would shoot any police officer who tried to enter.

Clarkstown police threw up a perimeter around the house. After Cordaro scanned that perimeter with a flashlight from a second-story window and fired a shot from a high-powered rifle, the department’s Critical Incident Response Team was called in and neighbors were warned to stay inside.

Police attempted to negotiate for four hours, but Cordaro alternately threatened officers, fired shots and hung up.

One of Cordaro’s shots hit a neighbor’s house; a babysitter and children spent the rest of the evening in the basement. Two others smashed another neighbor’s truck window.

After police lobbed tear gas into the room in an attempt to force him out, he fired twice at two members of the CIRT team. One fired back. Later, police entered the house and found Cordaro dead.

An autopsy found Cordaro had a blood alcohol level of .265 percent.

Zugibe issued a report this morning. Here is the full text.



INTRODUCTION:

A comprehensive review of the facts and circumstances relating to the death of Vincent Cordaro was undertaken by the Rockland County District Attorney’s Office. The report that follows is a synopsis of the evidence uncovered by that investigation.

Although Grand Jury proceedings by law are secret, the investigation into the death of Vincent Cordaro, conducted and developed outside the Grand Jury process, is not bound by any such rule of secrecy. Therefore, this report is being made available to the public.

According to numerous sources Vincent Cordaro had been suffering from severe depression for many years. Notwithstanding attempts to get treatment his problems reportedly persisted. According to family members, as his depression grew so did his use of alcohol. The deadly mix culminated in Mr. Cordaro making a number of failed attempts to commit suicide. In assessing the evidence in this case it became clear that the unfortunate events that unfolded on the night of February 8, 2015 were undoubtedly triggered by the combined effect of Vincent Cordaro’s depression, his alcohol abuse and his desire to take his own life. The loss of his life is tragic and highlights the continuing need to improve access to mental health services within our community.

On February 8, 2015 at approximately 11:41 p.m., Vincent Cordaro, age 58, was fatally shot by a police officer from the Town of Clarkstown Police Department. At the time, the officer was one of the three marksman teams deployed by Clarkstown Police Department’s CIRT team (Critical Incident Response Team) surrounding Mr. Cordaro’s home in response to complaints of shots being fired from the house.

Earlier in the evening at approximately 7:16 p.m. several members of the Cordaro family walked into the Clarkstown Police Department to report that Vincent Cordaro was intoxicated and had become very agitated. They further reported that he had brandished a shotgun and had threatened them with it, causing them to flee the house. The family members informed the police that as they left the house Vincent Cordaro told them that he would shoot any police officer that came to get him.

In response to this information the Clarkstown Police Department set up a perimeter around the residence and called Mr. Cordaro on the phone in an effort to get him to come out of the house peacefully. Mr. Cordaro would not agree to come out of the home and instead periodically fired shots out a south facing upper window of the residence. Over the next four hours Clarkstown crisis negotiators periodically spoke to Mr. Cordaro. Sometimes he would answer the phone and some times he would not. Most calls included direct threats by Mr. Cordaro to shoot and kill any of the officers surrounding his home and would end with Mr. Cordaro hanging up on the negotiators.

After negotiations apparently broke down and Mr. Cordaro refused to answer the phone a decision was made to introduce tear gas into the home in an effort to encourage Mr. Cordaro to come out. Moments after the gas was shot into the upper floor room occupied by Mr. Cordaro, he appeared in the south facing window with a high caliber rifle, aimed and fired in the direction of two CIRT team police officers. When he fired a second shot one of the officers fired a single shot striking and killing Mr. Cordaro. Mr. Cordaro was pronounced dead at the scene at 3:42 a.m. on February 9, 2015.

Three investigations immediately commenced: the Town of Clarkstown Police Department, the Rockland County Medical Examiner’s Office and the Rockland County District Attorneys Office. The investigations were independent; the investigating officers had no involvement whatsoever with the events leading up to Vincent Cordaro’s death.

Following the investigation, evidence was presented in this matter to a Rockland County Grand Jury. The Grand Jury heard testimony from witnesses and examined exhibits over the course of three (3) days. The Grand Jury has finished its investigation and found that the officer was justified in using deadly physical force against Vincent Cordaro and finds no basis for criminal charges against the officer arising out of the death.

BACKGROUND:

VINCENT CORDARO:

Mr. Cordaro was born on April 9, 1963. He resided at 67 N. Little Tor Road, New City, New York with his ex-wife, two adult children and his grandchild. He was an unemployed auto mechanic, although he continued to do some work out the garage at his residence. Mr. Cordaro had reportedly suffered from depression since the loss of his mother. Mr. Cordaro was also known to consume alcohol regularly. In fact he was described as a chronic alcoholic.

The investigation revealed that Mr. Cordaro’s behavior had become irrational, illogical and extremely dangerous to himself and others. The family reported that he spent most of his time in his room by himself.

Members of the Town of Clarkstown Police Department were familiar with Mr. Cordaro. Mr. Cordaro was arrested and indicted for Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance in the Fifth Degree (a felony), and Driving while Intoxicated and Operating a Motor Vehicle with more than .10 % BAC. He was convicted in Rockland County Court of the felony and sentenced to five (5) years probation. On another occasion he was also convicted of the crime of Menacing in the Clarkstown Justice Court and sentenced to three years on probation. In August of this year he was again arrested and charged with Driving while intoxicated.

In addition to his interaction with law enforcement involving his criminal cases, Mr. Cordaro also had numerous contacts with police officers concerning domestic disputes, excessive drinking and several documented attempts to commit suicide. The most recent suicide attempt occurred in August of 2014 when, in an effort to take his own life he attempted to throw himself in front of a train in the area of North Liberty Drive in Stony Point. When Stony Point Police Officers stopped him he reportedly became combative and told them that “it’s not illegal for me to kill myself”.

TOWN OF CLARKSTOWN POLICE DEPARTMENT:

The Town of Clarkstown Police Department is located at 20 Maple Avenue, New City, New York. The Town of Clarkstown Police Department is comprised of approximately one hundred seventy three (173) police officers that cover an area of approximately forty seven (47) square miles.

Every Clarkstown police officer must go through a Police Academy before becoming an officer. The Rockland County Police Academy, and other academies, teach new officers: how to handle a gun, how to fire it accurately, how to handle stressful situations, the fundamentals of shooting, diverging firearms scenarios, movements and defensive tactics, how to move and bring something to a conclusion as safe and quickly as possible. Every Clarkstown Police Officer re-certifies every year with respect to firearms.

In 1991 the Clarkstown Police Department formed the Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT). The unit was formed in response to a need for a highly trained tactical team to handle high risk warrants, barricaded felons and/or hostage situations. High standards were set for members of this unit. These standards include physical fitness, shooting skills, tactical movement, mental conditioning and their background with the department. The CIRT Team is a part time team and all members have regular duty assignments in the Police Department.

Training is conducted twice a month and one full week per year. Members have trained with the F.B.I., SWAT and the Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Some of the Senior members of the team have well over 3,000 hours of training. Some Team members are certified instructors in firearms, diversion devices, explosives and shotgun breaching, less lethal munitions, defensive tactics, ballistic shields, tactical movement, hostage negotiations, National Tactical Officers Association (NTOA) Certified Active Shooter Instructors, Multi-Assault Counter-Terrorism Action Capabilities (MACTAC) Instructors, and sniper-observer operations. Members serve as primary instructors for the Rockland County Police Academy recruit and in-service training program for active shooter and MACTAC classes.

POLICE WITNESSES:

LT. JEFFREY WANAMAKER:

Lt. Jeffrey Wanamaker has been a Clarkstown Police Officer for 28 years. It was his squad that was working the 3 to 11 shift on the evening of February 8, 2015.

At approximately 7:16 p.m., while at Clarkstown Police Headquarters he was advised that members of the Cordaro family had walked into the lobby of the police station to report that that they had been forced to flee their residence after Vincent Cordaro had threatened to shoot them. In their conversation with Lt. Wanamaker they reported that Vincent Cordaro was intoxicated, extremely agitated and was brandishing a loaded shotgun. They informed Lt. Wanamaker that as they left the house Vincent Cordaro told them that he would shoot any police officer who came to his house. They also informed him that there were numerous rifles in the residence in addition to the shotgun he was carrying.

Based upon the information provided by the family Lt. Wanamaker determined to set up a perimeter around the house at 67 N. Little Tor Road and to have a phone call be placed to Vincent Cordaro advising him to come out of the house. Detective Chris Kiernan, a crisis negotiator with the Clarkstown Police Department, was contacted to respond to police headquarters to establish this communication.

By approximately 7:55 p.m. a perimeter had been successfully set up around the residence. At that time, one of the perimeter officers, who was positioned on the corner of Victor Road and N. Little Tor. Road, observed Mr. Cordaro in a south side upper window using a flashlight to scan his immediate area. He reported that the lights in the room then went off and immediately following he heard a gun shot and saw a muzzle flash coming out the same south side window. The officer was close enough that he could smell the odor of burnt gunpowder and determined that the shot was a high caliber rifle and not a shotgun as had been originally reported. As a result Lt. Wanamaker conducted a roll call to determine whether any officers had been injured. He then advised all perimeter officers to pull back and to seek additional cover.

As it was determined that it was too dangerous to try and evacuate all the local residence, a reverse 911 call was placed advising them of the situation and requesting that they remain in their homes until further notice. (It was believed that people leaving their house would be exposed and a possible target for the shooter.) Telephone contact was eventually made with Vincent Cordaro and all officers were directed to maintain the perimeter as the negotiation process proceeded. It was further decided that the Clarkstown Police Department’s Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT) would be called out to the scene.

DET CHRISTOPHER KIERNAN:

On February 8, 2015 Det. Chris Kiernan, a Clarkstown Police Officer, was called out to work in his capacity as one of the crisis negotiators for Clarkstown’s CIRT Team.

Upon responding to the police station Det. Kiernan attempted to make contact with Vincent Cordaro. At approximately 7:58 p.m. the first phone contact was made with Mr. Cordaro. Over the next four hours Det. Kiernan attempted to talk him into surrendering and voluntarily walking out of the house with his hands up. Calls would be placed to the residence but typically ended with Mr. Cordaro hanging up. Of the numerous conversations Det. Kiernan had with Mr. Cordaro almost all contained a threat by Mr. Cordaro to shoot or kill the police officers surrounding his house. In one conversation he specifically told the officer that he had a sniper rifle and that he would pick off all of them one by one. He would, at times, also threaten to take his own life.

As the conversations continued additional shots were fired out the window including several shots that were fired while he was on the phone with the negotiator. In all, evidence suggests that a total of seven shots were fired by Mr. Cordaro through the course of the evening using a bolt action .308 caliber rifle. As the hours went by Mr. Cordaro’s mental state increasingly became erratic. Significantly he continued to refuse to In the final calls with Mr. Cordaro he became increasingly agitated by the presence of two CIRT team police officers hiding behind a tree line on the south side of his property. Mr. Cordaro demanded that they move or he would kill them. In fact, at times he would put the phone down and shout out the window to them to back off or he would kill them. The last conversation Mr. Cordaro had with the Clarkstown Police Negotiator was at approx. 11:20 p.m. After that call Mr. Cordaro refused and/or failed to answer the phone again.

STRASBURG, Colo. (CBS4)– A carjacking suspect was shot and killed Saturday morning after a pursuit that ended with a crash along Interstate 70.

Officers were trying to stop the carjacking suspect along I-70 near Deer Trail when the chase began. Colorado State Patrol troopers confirmed they tried using a “PIT” maneuver and spikes to try to stop the suspect.

“The resulting pursuit reached in excess of 100 mph,” said Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Capt. Jared Rowlison.

The suspect vehicle crashed into a ditch about 14 miles later and the suspect ran into a field where he engaged troopers in a standoff.

“He was just going up and down pacing the fence line and talking to the cops and he kept sitting down and standing up and he had a gun in his mouth and then he had it to the side of his head,” witness Terrence Boyd.

An Arapahoe County Sheriff’s deputy shot and killed the suspect during an exchange of gunfire.

“There was a significant threat to the deputy’s safety and the public’s safety as well, during this entire incident,” said Rowlison.

Officers say it all began when the suspect forced a driver and passenger out of a red Chevy Tahoe at gunpoint. He got inside and started speeding down the interstate.

“The safety message is, you’re on a highway. If you see somebody on the side of the road, dial *CSP and allow us to take the time to come out and investigate as to why that person is on the road,” said Colorado State Patrol Trooper Timothy Sullivan.

Troopers deployed stop sticks but the suspect kept driving. It was the “PIT” maneuver or Precision Immobilization Technique by the state trooper that brought the chase to an end and the deadly shooting of a suspect.

“Crazy because this is a little town. Stuff like this doesn’t happen around here,” said Boyd.

ARAPAHOE COUNTY, Colo. - The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office has identified a gunman who was shot and killed by a deputy last weekend after authorities say the suspect carjacked a vehicle on Interstate 70 and led police on a 100 mph chase.

In a Wednesday news release, sheriff's officials identified the dead man as Damien James Ramirez, 27, of Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The sheriff's office investigation found that Ramirez was a registered sex offender in New Mexico, who was wanted on two arrest warrants at the time of the shootout:

An arrest warrant for violation of his parole for a sexual assault conviction in New Mexico.
An arrest warrant was for violating his probation for a rape conviction in Bernalillo County, New Mexico.
""Both warrants indicated law enforcement officers should use caution due to a concern of violence,"" the sheriff's office release stated. ""New Mexico officials believed Ramirez was armed and dangerous and learned he made recent comments about not going back to jail and planned on killing as many people as possible when contacted by law enforcement.""

The deadly police pursuit began about 6:26 a.m. Saturday when the Colorado State Patrol received a report of a single car crash on westbound I-70 near mile marker 324. At about 7:20 a.m., an Arapahoe County deputy sheriff arrived in the area to check on the people involved in the crash.

Soon afterward, a state trooper saw a man walking on I-70, some distance from the crash site. As the trooper attempted to contact the man, he saw that the man was armed with a handgun, sheriff's officials said.

The gunman ran into the I-70 median and stopped a red Chevy Tahoe at gunpoint. The gunman ordered two occupants of the Tahoe get out and he jumped into the driver's seat and sped off, said sheriff's Capt. Jared Rowlison..

The trooper saw the carjacking and pursued the suspect in the stolen Tahoe. The pursuit reached speeds of more than 100 mph and ended when the Tahoe crashed on the westbound off ramp at Exit 310 in Strasburg, sheriff's officials said.

As officers from several law enforcement agencies  arrived in the area, gunfire was exchange between the suspect and officers. An Arapahoe County deputy  shot and killed Ramirez, sheriff's officials said.  The involved deputy was placed on routine paid administrative leave.

Ramirez died from a gunshot wound to the chest, the Arapahoe County coroner said. The manner of death was classified as homicide, which legally means he died at the hands of another.

No law enforcement officers or members of the public were injured during the incident.

The 18th Judicial District Critical Response Team is investigating the officer-involved shoot. The investigation is ongoing.

AZUSA >> Police shot and killed a man Sunday afternoon after confronting him following a break-in at his neighbor’s house, officials said.

The 24-year-old man died at a hospital following the shooting, which took place just before 1 p.m. in the 400 block of E. Lee Drive, said Lt. Holly Francisco of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau, which is leading the investigation. His name was not released.

• Video: Man shot by police following a break-in

“A family member called 9-1-1 stating one of their family members was acting insane and had injured himself,” Francisco said. “The call was updated that the suspect was breaking into a house nearby.”

“When officers got on scene, they found the suspect, who had broken into a house, and as they cleared the house, an officer-involved shooting did occur,’ Francisco said. No officers were hurt.

No gun found was from the scene, Francisco said. Several items, such as tools, were found near the spot where the shooting occurred, but it was not clear whether they may have played a role in the incident.

Further details regarding the shooting were not available Sunday, as investigators were yet to interview the involved officer, Francisco said.

Nearby resident Jesse Zarate, 76, said he saw a police officer shoot a bloody man who had broken into a neighbor’s home.

The officer confronted the man behind the home and ordered him to stop, Zarate said. The man responded “shoot me, shoot me” and continued running toward neighboring homes.

The officer fired three times, Zarate said. The man fell to the ground wounded.

“I don’t blame the police,” Zarate said. “What if he could have gotten out and hurt somebody else.”

When police first encountered the suspect, “He was bloody. All the house was bloody,” Zarate said.

It was not clear if the blood was due to the injuries the suspect inflicted on himself at the outset of the incident, or due to the several windows in the home that had been smashed, Francisco said. The lieutenant declined to discuss exactly where on his body the suspect had been shot, but said he had not been shot in the back.

Distraught family members of the fatally wounded suspect gathered at the scene and consoled each other. They declined to comment.

The home that was broken into was empty at the time, officials and neighbors said. The residents returned to the neighborhood as the investigation continued. They also declined to comment.",Yes,No,,No,,"NA ,

Shortly before 1 p.m., officers from the Azusa Police Department responded to the 500 block of East Lee Drive after receiving a report that a person with unknown injuries was acting in a bizarre manner, a news release from the Sheriff's Department stated.

The caller indicated the person was trying to break into a home, according to the release.

Sheriff's Lt. Holly Francisco later said dispatchers also received a 911 call from a relative of the man who said he was ""acting insane."" The man evidently lived in the home next door to the one he was trying to enter.

When officers arrived, a neighbor informed them that they heard a female screaming inside the residence.

The officers entered the home and located the man. At some point, they opened fire, hitting the man suspected of breaking into the home, according to the release.

Although authorities have not stated what exactly prompted the officers to fire their weapons, a woman at the scene told KTLA her grandfather witnessed the entire confrontation and said the man yelled at police to shoot him prior to being struck by gunfire.

“He saw police officers come in because they were called to the fact there was a … break-in over at a neighbor’s house,"" Shanice Corralego said. ""He was with my cousin at the time, and when he saw the person that broke in, yelling at the cops, to shoot him, shoot him, and then try to run away. And then they shot him three times.”

The man -- identified by sheriff's officials only as a 24-year-old Azusa resident -- was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced deceased.

It was not known whether the man was armed.

No officers were injured in the incident, which was being investigated by Azusa police and the Sheriff's Department.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the sheriff's Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500.

Those who would prefer to provide information anonymously have been urged to contact Crime Stoppers by dialing 800-222-8477, texting the letters TIPLA plus a tip to 274637, or by using the website http://lacrimestoppers.org.

AZUSA >> Los Angeles County Sheriff’s homicide detectives on Monday identified a man killed in an officer-involved shooting in Azusa.

Adrian Simental, 24, of Azusa, was shot by Azusa police officers just before 1 p.m. Sunday in the 400 block of East Lee Drive, according to a sheriff’s information bureau statement.

Simental died at a hospital following the shooting, which took place when Azusa police responded to a report of a suspect breaking into a neighbor’s house. Someone initially called 9-1-1 saying that a family member was “acting insane and had injured himself,” Lt. Holly Francisco said Sunday.

When officers arrived on scene, they found the suspect, later identified as Simental, as they cleared the house and an officer-involved shooting occurred, Francisco said.

Detectives were at the scene Monday afternoon, interviewing witnesses around the neighborhood. Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Detective Donna Cheek said there was no new information in the case and that an autopsy had not yet happened.

Blood spatter still could be seen down the street, trailed on the sidewalk toward the end of the block, where a portion of yellow caution tape was still tied to a chain link fence.

No gun was found at the scene, officials have said. A neighbor reported seeing a police officer fire three shots at a bloody man who had broken into a neighbor’s home.

According to online county booking records, Simental was arrested by Azusa police on three occasions in 2013. A Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office spokesman said Simental was previously charged with misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon — a skateboard — giving false information to a police officer and vandalism of mobile park home property.",Yes,No,,No,,http://image.dailybulletin.com/storyimage/LF/20150622/NEWS/150629858/AR/0/AR-150629858.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667,No,,,,,,,,,,1:00 PM,Indoors,Residence,,Police responding to a reported offense by the victim,,Burglary/Breaking &amp; Entering,,,,No,Yes,No,No,Yell at or insult the officer,,None of the above,,No clear justification given,,Refused to follow officer orders,,Exact number given.

Mystery surrounds the actions of a reportedly suicidal World Golf Village condominium owner fatally shot by two St. Johns deputies Monday afternoon while armed with a sword-like, serrated knife.

The Sheriff’s Office released a few new details Tuesday morning in the death of Justin Edward Way, 28, including that his live-in girlfriend called 911 to report him being despondent.

The Times-Union has also learned that deputies were called to Way’s home in November 2013 after a neighbor reported being worried about his well-being after hearing a thud and him yelling, possibly while drunk. No trouble occurred on that call.

Information such as what Way did to cause the deputies to fire and why he was despondent have yet to emerge as the case remains in its infancy. Police officers involved in shootings can’t be compelled to give a statement before consulting with their union representatives, as is the case in Way’s death.

Sheriff’s Office spokesman Cmdr. Chuck Mulligan said more details may come out soon as the agency decides whether to release the 911 call, the names and backgrounds of the deputies and other information.

But Mulligan said the deputies apparently had a reason to fire simultaneously.

“Obviously both deputies felt threatened,” Mulligan said.

The shooting occurred about 4:30 p.m. in a gated community in the 200 block of Presidents Cup Way. Mulligan said Way’s girlfriend called authorities to help with his suicidal threats and met the two deputies outside the condo, telling them he was despondent and that she left the door open for them.

The encounter between Way and the deputies occurred moments later in a bedroom, where his sword-like weapon also was found.

This is the first police shooting of the year for the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office. Last year St. Johns deputies shot five people and killed four of them. Both deputies have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in police shootings.

Way does not have an arrest record in Florida, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. He has owned the condominium since 2011, records show.",Yes,No,,No,,http://sar-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14379804.jpg,http://www.news4jax.com/news/local/st-johns-deputies-investigating-deputy-involved-shooting,St. Johns deputies investigating deputy-involved shooting,"St. Johns deputies investigating deputy-involved shooting

ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. - The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office continues to investigate why deputies shot and killed 28-year-old Justin Edward Way, who was apparently threatening suicide in World Golf Village.

Investigators said deputies were called to the Legends Condominiums around 4:30 p.m. Monday by a woman in the same condo with the man who was shot.

When deputies arrived they said the man was holding a large knife and something happened that prompted them to open fire officials said. 

According to reports, there were two deputies inside the home when the shooting happened but officials did not say if one or both of the deputies fired.

Both deputies will be placed on administrative leave during the investigation, which is standard procedure.

The sheriff's office said it can't release the name of the woman who called 911 and met deputies outside the home to say she was concerned the man was going to kill himself.

""Let's hold off on any sort of speculation. Let's get into the investigation. We've got some interviews to do with individuals who knew the subject to determine what was going on, what his state of mind was. That's all part of what we do in investigation,"" Sheriff's Office Cmdr. Chuck Mulligan said. 

This is the first deputy-involved shooting of the year in St. Johns County. The department had five in 2014, the most in any one year in its history.

WAKE FOREST, N.C. (WNCN) – A man police say charged at officers with a kitchen knife was shot and killed by a Wake Forest police officer Friday night.

The shooting occurred just before 11 p.m. at 1117 Chamberwell Ave.

The man, who has been identified as Alan Joseph Rushton, 38, was transported to WakeMed after being shot by a Wake Forest police officer, police said.

Authorities responded to the home on Chamberwell Avenue at approximately 8:30 p.m. in response to a domestic disturbance. Upon their arrival, officers attempted to speak to Rushton, who fled to the second floor of the home, police said.

In a 911 call made before the shooting, the caller details the domestic dispute.

The caller said Rushton cornered her into a closet and slammed her face into a door frame. He also disabled the home’s wifi and locked her cellphone, preventing her from calling family for help, according to the caller.

“He’s not going to go easily,” the caller told the 911 dispatcher.

Police said that officers attempted to make contact with Rushton on the second floor at which time he displayed a large kitchen knife. After multiple commands to drop the knife, Rushton barricaded himself inside an upstairs room.

Rushton was alone in the home when police arrived except for a St. Bernard dog, the 911 call revealed.

The caller describes the dog as a “big baby.”

“Just please don’t hurt my dog,” the caller said.

Police called in the Tactical Service Unit to the scene, as well as a crisis negotiator. For approximately two hours, negotiators asked Rushton to surrender, but he refused to and made numerous threats, police said.

Rushton then charged officers with the knife which resulted in the officer firing his gun at the suspect.

The officer who fired his weapon at Rushton has been identified as Officer Dustin d’Hemecourt. The officer has been a member of the Wake Forest Police Department since February 2014.

Police said that Friday evening marked the second time in two months Wake Forest Police responded to Rushton’s home. On July 21 officers responded to a domestic disturbance in which Rushton had also barricaded himself inside the home and communicated threats. In that incident he exited the residence after several hours.

The State Bureau of Investigation and Wake Forest police are investigating the shooting and d’Hemecourt has been placed on administrative leave with pay.

Wake Forest Police Chief Jeff Leonard issued a statement.

It is a tragedy any time our officers are forced to use deadly force against a citizen we are sworn to serve and protect. We worked extremely hard to peacefully resolve the situation in an attempt to get Mr. Rushton the help he needed. Unfortunately, by his actions, he forced the response of our Tactical Service Unit. We extend our thoughts and prayers to Mr. Rushton’s family, as well as to Officer d’Hemecourt.”
The investigation is ongoing.

This is the second time since May that a Wake Forest police officer has shot and killed a suspect.

David William Johnson, 18, died on May 6 after he was shot by officers at approximately 9:30 p.m. on Grandmark Street. Police said that Johnson led police on a chase, crashed his car and then refused to drop the gun he was armed with.

Police said that officers D. Cohen and D. Ragland gave multiple verbal commands to Johnson to drop his weapon. Johnson failed to comply and both officers fired their weapons, striking Johnson multiple times.

WAKE FOREST, N.C. — Wake County prosecutors won't file any charges against a Wake Forest police officer in an August shooting that killed a domestic violence suspect. 

Officer Dustin d'Hemecourt shot Alan Joseph Rushton, 38, on Aug. 21 as officers tried to take him into custody. 

Rushton's wife had called 911 to report that he shoved her head into a closet door and took her car keys before locking her outside their 1117 Chamberwell Ave. home. 

When officers arrived, he repeatedly threatened them with a large kitchen knife before barricading himself in a room. Negotiators tried for about two hours to get him to surrender, police said, and d'Hemecourt shot Rushton when he charged them with the knife, striking one officer on his helmet. 

""The use of deadly force by Officer d'Hemecourt does not give rise to grounds for criminal prosecution,"" Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman wrote in a letter Friday to the State Bureau of Investigation, which reviewed the shooting per protocol. 

d'Hemecourt, a tactical services unit officer, has been a member of the Wake Forest Police Department since February 2014.

Sand City >> (The story has been updated here.)

Police officers fatally shot two people in a gunfight in the parking lot of a Target store in Sand City’s Edgewater Shopping Center on Monday.

Around 3:30 p.m., two Sand City police officers attempted to serve warrants on two people when the suspects opened fire on the officers, police said. Both officers were wounded and both suspects were killed, Sand City Police Chief Brian Ferrante and District Attorney Dean Flippo announced in a joint media briefing Monday afternoon at the scene.

“After the officers confronted them, the suspects opened fire,” said Ferrante. “Both officers injured were transported to the hospital via ambulance and are in stable condition.”

Bouchra Gygax, a student at Monterey Peninsula College, was trying to find parking at the shopping center off Highway 1 when she saw two policemen holding up a third man and the foot of another person sticking out of a car in front of them.

“While I was waiting people started pulling out their phones and somebody said, ‘The cop got shot and he shot back,’” Gygax said.

The scene quickly became chaotic, she said, as she saw patrol cars and ambulances coming from everywhere.

“It was crazy,” she said.

Ferrante requested the DA’s Bureau of Investigation conduct the investigation.

“We now have 15 investigators that are involved in gathering evidence both here” and at Natividad Medical Center, said Flippo.

Officers from Seaside, Marina, Monterey, the California Highway Patrol and the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office aided Sand City police at the scene. No further information was released on the two suspects pending notification of next of kin.

Ferrante said the officers knew the suspects and knew they had outstanding warrants.

“Fortunately no innocent bystanders were involved,” Ferrante said.

Though Target was closed in the wake of the shooting, the other 20 or so businesses in the shopping center stayed open.

Two people died and two officers were wounded after gunfire broke out in the parking lot of the Sand City Target on Monday afternoon.

Sand City police officers had learned that two people with outstanding warrants were at the location and were executing the warrants when the shooting occurred.

The officers' wounds were not life threatening, and they were in stable condition as of mid-afternoon, authorities said. The names of the deceased have not been released pending notification of next of kin.

Yellow police tape cordoned off a large area of the busy shopping center as numerous law enforcement agencies swarmed the scene and a helicopter circled overhead.

Nearby shoppers and onlookers lined the scene as Target employees arriving for work were turned away. It appeared that the shooting occurred in one of the rows directly in front of the store's main entrance.

""It's obviously a tragic situation,"" said San City Police Chief Brian Ferrante. ""We're very concerned about our officers. We're concerned about the families of those who have been killed. I think fortunately there were no innocent bystanders that were injured. This was all contained in a very small area.""

Noting that the Sand City Police Department is a small agency, he added that the department is ""like a small family.""

Ferrante requested that the Monterey County District Attorney's Office investigate the officer-involved shooting.

Monterey County District Attorney Dean Flippo was at the scene Monday and he said about 15 district attorney investigators were gathering evidence there as well as at Natividad Medical Center.

Due to the early stages of the investigation, officials declined to immediately release further details as to how the incident occurred, and Flippo stressed that law enforcement officials were still seeking information themselves.

Pacific Grove resident Kim Fulton came to the scene after hearing about it at her nearby work and became emotional as she expressed gratitude to Ferrante for the officers' work.

""It's just so sad when it hits so close to home ... It's all the ugliness. What is it all over?"" she asked. ""Is it worth somebody's life?""

Seaside native Pastor Ulysses Allen also had rushed to the scene because his son was worried one of his friends in the police apartment had been hurt.

Allen recalled how area crime rose in the late '80s and said he is now seeing it again. He added that people ""better get God in their heart.""

""There is enough going on in Seaside that it is not a surprise to me,"" he said. ""There's a lot of criminal element on the streets and the next thing you know, it's at Target.""

Seaside >> Linda Holovits described her son William Spaits as “someone who always wants to do whatever he wants to do.”

On Tuesday, the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office identified Spaits, 27, as one those fatally shot Monday in the parking lot of the Target store in Sand City. Spaits’ girlfriend, 23-year-old Tina Money, was also killed in the shootout with Sand City police that left two officers wounded.

A third person in a stolen car driven by the suspects was arrested, the District Attorney’s Office said.

The shootout occurred about 3:30 p.m. Monday when police tried to serve a warrant on Spaits and Money.

Spaits was wanted on a no-bail parole violation and $300,000 in other outstanding warrants, District Attorney Dean Flippo said. Spaits failed to appear while out on bail and a warrant was issued for his arrest Sept. 14.

Sand City police were attempting to serve that warrant when the gun battle broke out. The two policemen were wounded and taken to a local hospital. One was released Monday evening, and the other was expected to be released Tuesday, according to Sand City police.

Spaits was pronounced dead at the scene.

Spaits was charged with burglary in February 2013 and with domestic abuse and robbery in December 2014. He also had previous convictions for check forgery and second-degree burglary.

Tina Money was charged in June with child abuse and with possession of controlled substances. The medications she was said to have without prescriptions were diazepam, used to treat anxiety disorders; hydrochloride bupropion, an antidepressant; tramadol, a pain reliever; and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant.

Money was scheduled to appear in court, but after failing to show up for three hearings, a warrant was issued for her arrest on Aug. 21. Flippo said she had warrants totaling $160,000.

She was pronounced dead at the hospital.

“It was strange,” said Holovits. “... I was at Costco (in the Sand Dollar Shopping Center across the street) and this check-out woman told me there was a mess at the Target store. She said something about a shooting, but I had no idea.”

Holovits said officers from the District Attorney’s investigative team and the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office came to her Seaside home about 11:30 p.m. Monday. They presented the news that both Spaits and his girlfriend of about 10 years had been shot and killed.

According to Holovits, one of the officers shot in the gunfight is a cousin of Money. Assistant District Attorney Rolando Mazariegos said the names of the officers have not been released pending a determination of whether they would face any danger.

Holovits said police told her that once Spaits spotted the officers, he ran toward the stolen BMW they were driving and jumped into the car head first. She was not sure if they said it was through the driver’s open door or the passenger’s open window, but he landed on top of his girlfriend.

The police asked if Holovits knew the third person who was seated in the back seat, and she told them she had no idea who it could have been.

It’s standard procedure for police officers to attempt to contact individuals who are known to have outstanding warrants, as was the case in Sand City, Mazariegos said. Officers will review faces and check them against police databases.

“A warrant is a court order commanding any peace officer to make an arrest when possible,” Mazariegos said.

Officers in Monterey Peninsula cities often work together, so even though Spaits and Money were wanted for crimes in Seaside, the Sand City officers had a duty to make the arrest, Mazariegos said.

Mazariegos would not say how many shots were fired because that information is part of the investigation the District Attorney is conducting about the incident.

Holovits said her son went to Ord Terrace Elementary School and high school for a time before finishing up at the Monterey County Youth Center in Salinas. The Youth Center is a residential, education and rehabilitation program for juvenile wards of the court.

Holovits recalled going to a parents night at the Youth Center where a teacher said “Willie” was “a pleasure to have in class and a good student. He showed us work he had done and a map he had created. I was so proud of him when he did well then,” she said.

But she recalled many sleepless nights when she worried about her son.

“I went to pick him up many times in the middle of the night,” she said.

“After he started driving, he came and went as he pleased,” said Holovits. She said that though her home was his home, Spaits was there only between stints in jail and that he and Money started living elsewhere.

“I’d run into them around town,” Holovits said. “I’d tell him, ‘You should have gone to court.’”

She said she long suspected drug abuse and worried something bad might happen.

“He wanted to get into a program ... one they could be in together. I was so happy when they found one in Santa Cruz,” Holovits said. But when the deadline came he called and backed out. In the end, Holovits only heard from her son and his girlfriend occasionally.

“I told him don’t tell me what you’re doing but let me know how you’re doing,” she said.

Holovits said Spaits and Money have a 5-year-old daughter who has a birthday coming up next month.

“He was loving and caring to his family when he wanted to be, but he really loved his daughter, Tina and me,” she said. Holovits and Money’s mother have been taking turns caring for the child.

Holovits said police promised to keep her informed and that an autopsy would happen Wednesday.

Holovits and her struggle to get U.S. citizenship for her Hungarian-born husband who was killed in the Vietnam War were featured in The Herald in July.

No charges will be filed against police officers involved in a shooting in a Sand City Target parking lot last September that left two people dead and two officers injured, the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office announced on Friday.

Around 2:47 p.m. on Sept. 21, a Target security guard was watching security surveillance when he recognized a man coming in who had made fraudulent purchases with stolen credit cards there before, according to the DA’s summary of facts on the case. The man was William Spaits, 27, of Seaside, who had driven to the store with Tina Money, 23, and Gregory Warren, 35, both also of Seaside.

Spaits had entered the store while Money and Warren remained in the vehicle parked in the store's busy lot.

The security guard called police, and Sand City Police Officers Jeff Bushnell and Larry Escobar responded to the store, arriving in separate units. The officers had been alerted to be on the lookout for Spaits and Money in connection to various other area crimes, including a residential burglary in Pebble Beach that morning.

The uniformed officers parked and began walking separate entrances of the store.

At this time, Spaits left the store and began walking to his silver BMW where Money sat in the passenger seat and Warren sat in the back.

When Spaits saw Bushnell approach, he ran toward his vehicle.

Both officers began running toward Spaits, and Target surveillance video showed that Spaits wasn’t carrying a visible weapon nor did either officer pull out his weapon at this time, the DA’s office detailed.

The officers yelled at Spaits to stop, but he didn’t comply and instead dove headfirst through the BMW’s open passenger window while yelling “Under the mat!”

Both officers knew of Spaits and Money and their extensive criminal histories. At the time, Spaits was a wanted felon with $300,000 in arrest warrants, and Money was also wanted on $160,000 of warrants and a suspect in a theft case.  Also, Escobar is related in some way to Money, who is the mother of Spaits’ child, the DA’s office detailed.

When Spaits jumped into the vehicle, landing on top of Money, Escobar began pulling at his legs to try to get him out of the vehicle as Bushnell ran to the driver’s side and pulled the keys out of the ignition.

The officers then struggled with Spaits, and at some point, Money reached under the driver’s side mat and handed a gun to Spaits, according to the DA’s office. She also struggled with the Escobar while yelling at Bushnell to let go of Spaits.

Spaits then pointed a .22 caliber gun at Escobar’s head and fired twice at the officer, striking him once on the right side of his chest. The officer collapsed outside the passenger side of the car and began to lose consciousness as he reported on the radio that shots were fired.

Spaits turned the gun toward Bushnell, firing two rounds including one that struck Bushnell once on the left side of his neck.

Escobar remained conscious as he then drew his gun, got up into a crouched position and fired it at Spaits while nearly at the same time Bushnell also fired his gun at Spaits.

Spaits died from his gunshot wounds at the scene, and Money, who was still in the passenger side with Spaits partially on top of her, was hit and also later died from gunshot wounds at the hospital.

Warren wasn’t injured in the shooting.

Both officers were hospitalized, and Bushnell was released later that day. Escobar was hospitalized overnight, and the bullet remains in his body.

Each officer had fired three times while Spaits had fired four times.

The entire incident, from the time Spaits ran to his vehicle to when Escobar fired shots, lasted just 43 seconds, according to Target surveillance video reviewed by the DA’s office. The DA’s review of the incident also included interviews with more than 40 civilian witnesses to the shooting.

In an interview, Warren said Spaits and Money had picked him up before going to stores to buy things with a stolen credit card and that Spaits and Money had smoked methamphetamine in the car on the way to Target. At the time of the shooting, Warren was arrested for a probation violation but was not involved in the shooting in any way other than being in the vehicle, according to past reports.

Toxicology results found a toxic level of methamphetamine in both Money and Spaits at the time of death, according to the DA’s summary of facts.

In explaining why the officers were not charged, the DA’s review referenced governing law that anybody, including a police officer, can use deadly force in self-defense or in defense of others if they reasonably believe it’s needed to defend against an imminent danger.

“At the time the officers responded to Spaits with lethal force, they both perceived Spaits as a significant threat to human life based on what they personally experienced and their previous knowledge,” the report reads, adding that both officers knew Spaits had a propensity to flee with “reckless disregard for the safety of others.”

The DA’s review also noted that Money was not an innocent bystander in the incident since she had handed Spaits the firearm and fought against the officers.",Yes,Yes,http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91f713d2c0fa129f6534ee6b70167a323a7f04a8/c=16-0-505-652&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/09/22/Salinas/B9318969899Z.1_20150922215437_000_GTVC0UOVF.1-0.jpg,No,,"http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1c37c409874c24fa48e371404c811cefa97ee36a/c=216-0-3672-2592&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/23/Salinas/B9318984118Z.1_20150923183629_000_G0EC196V2.1-0.jpg ,

SCENE PHOTOS: Officers involved in shooting

A 911 caller told authorities they witnessed a man and woman arguing at Robinson Park about 3:30 p.m. Friday. The caller said the man shoved the woman into a black sport utility vehicle.


Officers spotted the man's SUV near Eighth Street and Central Avenue a short time later and attempted to stop it. The man initially pulled over near Fourth Street at Bridge but then fled, police said.

The driver, who was identified as Rafael Molina Jr., 33, headed east on Avenida Cesar Chavez, and a female passenger was able to bail out of the vehicle before the shooting, authorities said.

The woman suffered minor injuries.

Officers attempted another traffic stop near Edith and Garfield, at which time shots were fired, police said. Witnesses said they recalled hearing at least three shots.

Tap to hear witness accounts

On Saturday, Albuquerque Police Spokesperson Celina Espinoza gave an update into the investigation saying that a .22-caliber pistol was found near Molina’s body, and that a witness saw Molina raise the gun, pointing it at officers.

Espinoza added that the safety was disengaged on the weapon and that the gun was loaded.

""The preliminary report, again, is that he had a gun in his hand, and our officers gave him verbal commands and orders, and shots were fired,"" said Police Chief Gorden Eden.

Espinoza says that lapel footage from the shooting is being reviewed, and that investigators are waiting for a search warrant to search Molina’s vehicle.

Molina had been arrested in May on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to authorities.

Police: New details on officer-involved shooting in southeast Albuquerque
ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) – Albuquerque police say the man officers shot and killed Friday afternoon had a semi-automatic handgun and at least one witness says he was raising his gun when officers fired.

Rafael Molina Jr., 33, was identified as the suspect shot and killed in the officer involved shooting on Edith and Garfield Friday.

The incident began around 3:30 p.m. when a 911 caller said they witnessed Molina and a female arguing in Robinson Park. The caller said a man wearing a red shirt was in a black SUV when he forcefully shoved a female into the vehicle.

Officers spotted the vehicle near 8th and Central a short time later.

They attempted to pull Molina over. He began to pull to the side of the road near 4th St. and Bridge Ave., but then sped off. Molina then headed eastbound on Avenida Cesar Chavez.

The female in the car was able to bail out of the SUV near Southern. She sustained minor injuries.

Officers continued to follow Molina and conducted a pit maneuver on the car near Edith and Garfield. Molina ran from the car. Police say he was holding a handgun. A news release sent out Friday claims a witness say Molina raise the gun, a “High Standard” Sport King .22cal LR semi-auto handgun, before officers fired.

APD spokesperson Celina Espinoza did not know how many shots were fired by officers nor how many hit Molina. Police say at least one officer fired shots and two are on standard paid leave while the investigation continues.

Molina was pronounced dead on scene.

Online court records for Molina show he is a felon who had a pending aggravated assault charge stemming from a May arrest.

There is on-body camera video of the incident but police have not released it yet. As of Saturday afternoon, investigators are waiting on a search warrant to look through the suspect’s car.

HOMINY — A man reportedly killed a woman before being fatally shot by a police officer following a vehicle pursuit Thursday in Osage County.
The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation was on the scene four miles west of Hominy where the officer-involved shooting occurred.
The first shooting was reported after 11 a.m. near a residence a mile north of Wolco on Oklahoma 11.
Two men and a woman were outside the residence when one of the men reportedly began acting suicidal, Osage County Sheriff Ty Koch said. The woman was fatally shot when she tried to intercede, he said.
As the other man ran to get help, the man who fired the fatal shot drove off. Authorities began searching for the vehicle after learning of the shooting through 911 calls.
A Skiatook police officer saw the vehicle driving fast and began a pursuit. The man was reportedly driving erratically west of Hominy when the vehicle went into a ditch along Oklahoma 20, Koch said.
Witnesses reported that the man pulled a weapon after exiting the vehicle and was shot by the officer, Koch said. A Skiatook detective said the man was pronounced dead on arrival at Cleveland Area Hospital.
Identifications of the shooting victims and the officer have not been released.

OSAGE COUNTY, Oklahoma - The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation has confirmed it has been asked to investigate shootings that happened in Osage County late Thursday morning, one of which was officer-involved.

A man, who apparently was suicidal, shot and killed a woman when she tried to intervene, the Osage County Sheriff's Office said. It took place around 11 a.m. in the community of Wolco, which is near Avant.

Witnesses reported the shooting after the woman made her way to a nearby home to plead for help. Law enforcement issued a bulletin for nearby officers to be on the lookout for the alleged shooter's vehicle. A Skiatook police officer noticed the man driving through Skiatook, which led to a high-speed pursuit that went down Highway 20 and ended 4 miles west of Hominy.

Osage County deputies and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol also were involved in the pursuit.

At the end of the chase about 30 miles away from the initial shooting, the man reportedly got out of his vehicle and pointed a gun at the law enforcement officers. When he did, a Skiatook police officer fired at him, OCSO said.
The man had to be driven to the closest hospital 14 miles away because medical helicopters were grounded in the severe weather. He was pronounced dead at the Cleveland Area Hospital.

Pending notification of next of kin, authorities have not released the names of the man or woman killed.

OHP had a portion of Highway 20 blocked between Hominy and Ralston for a few hours, but it has been reopened.

""You're here to save lives, and that's the last thing you want to see happen,"" Osage County investigator Charlie Cartwright said. ""First off, my heart goes out to all the families. But then that officer, it's something that will affect him. I've seen this happen before with officers, and it affects them their entire lives.""

SAN BERNARDINO — The officer-involved shooting that resulted in the death of an Apple Valley man last year has been deemed ""legally justified"" by the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office, according to a statement released Thursday.
Francis Murphy Rose III, 42, was killed in a shootout near his home in an unincorporated county area near Apple Valley in February 2015, after sheriff's deputies responded to 911 calls of shots fired in the 9000 block of Buena Vista Street.
According to a previous Daily Press report, when deputies arrived, authorities said Rose began shooting at the deputies, as well as sheriff's helicopter 40 King that was circling above. Rose was then shot by a deputy on the ground.
An autopsy performed on Rose by Riverside County Coroner's Office found five principal gunshot wounds that were listed as the cause of death and toxicology reports revealed that Rose had a blood-alcohol level of more than 0.22 — nearly three times the legal limit of 0.08 — and numerous drugs in his system, including ones used to treat bipolar disorder.
According to the investigation report provided by the District Attorney's Office, deputies tried ""to make contact with Rose when they were told that he was unarmed,"" but when he was ordered to show his hands he retreated back into his residence and began shooting.
""Once Rose initiated the gunbattle, the deputies involved had the legal right to engage Rose in lawful self-defense and defense of others. The deputies returned fire only when they were fired upon,"" the investigation report said.
A former California Highway Patrol officer who worked out of the Barstow Station from the fall of 2009 to March 2013, Rose was described by his friends as a ""good and kind"" person who was ""going through hard times"" trying to escape a rough life.
""I've known Murphy Rose most of his life and am in tears that this has happened,"" Diana Schmidt, a close friend, previously told the Daily Press. ""He was a highway patrol officer who saw his partner killed in front of him. Some of the things he saw and (dealt) with (left) him (with post-traumatic stress disorder). Sadly this was suicide by cop. He was not a thug or a bad person (but) chose a sad way to end his pain.""",No,,,,,,http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Ex-CHP-Officer-Killed-Sheriffs-Deputies-High-Desert-290716281.html,Inner Demons Haunted Ex-CHP Officer Killed in Deputy Shootout: Neighbors,"Inner Demons Haunted Ex-CHP Officer Killed in Deputy Shootout: Neighbors

Apple Valley Man Arrested for Felony Evading
August 31, 2016

APPLE VALLEY:(VVNG.com)- The man fatally shot by police after an exchange in gunfire has been identified as 42-year-old Francis Murphy Rose III, a resident of the unincorporated area of Apple Valley.

On Monday, February 2, 2015, at approximately 6:21 p.m., Sheriff’s dispatch received reports of shots fired in the 9000 block of Buena Vista Street.

When deputies responded the location, for unknown reasons Rose began firing at the officers. A sheriff’s helicopter was requested to assist with over head support.

Per scanner traffic, the suspect armed with a rifle started to fire live rounds at the helicopter. After an exchange in gunfire with deputies on the ground, Rose was fatally wounded and pronounced deceased at the scene.

Family and friends still can’t understand why all of this happened. Leaving those who knew him shocked and in disbelief. Francis Rose, better known as Murphy, is described as a loving type of guy that was liked by many.

Murphy served with the California Highway Patrol and was forced into early retirement a couple of years ago, after he was brutally beaten during a traffic stop on Highway 40. The beating left Murphy suffering from severe back problems, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression.

According to those who knew Murphy, in 2014 his depression was so bad that Murphy attempted taking his own life. As a result from that incident his registered guns were taken from him. Murphy had his guns returned back to him not long ago.

The investigation is ongoing and no additional information is available for release.

COLUMBIA, TN (WSMV) -
An elderly man was shot and killed on Thursday after police said he pointed a gun at officers.

Columbia police said 86-year-old Raymond K. Phillips left his home armed with guns and threatened to kill himself.

""It's sad, but there's a lot of people who have mentality problems who don't get help,"" said Melissa Cameron, who lives near the scene.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is now handling the case.

""The driver was pronounced dead at the scene, no officers injured,"" said Susan Niland, TBI spokesperson.

The TBI said the incident started with a welfare check. Police were searching for Phillips when three officers found him on Bear Creek Drive.

That's where police said Phillips stepped out of his vehicle and raised his gun. The officers opened fire.

""It was kind of scary being so close to home,"" Cameron said. ""It's kind of like, whoa, keep an eye on your kids. You know what I mean?""

This is not the first time Columbia police have used deadly force. In 2011, police checked on Darren Cole, who was also threatening suicide. When Cole hit one of the officers with a stick, he was shot by another officer. Cole later died.

Thursday's shooting stirred mixed emotions among residents.

""It's said they came to that conclusion, but what else were they supposed to do?"" Cameron said.

Police said the three officers were put on administrative leave with pay while the investigation continues.

Melbourne police officers shot and killed a man suspected in several recent armed robberies in a Burger King parking lot late Sunday night.

Police said they believed that 36-year-old Matthew Wayne McDaniel may have been casing the establishment on S. Harbor City Boulevard for another robbery.

Police said McDaniel drove into the parking lot in a white, older model Lincoln and when he saw officers – both plain clothes and uniformed – approaching, he pulled out a handgun. Within 30 seconds, he was met with a volley of bullets that shattered the car's windows and left him slumped over and bloodied in the driver's seat.

""He attempted to flee in his vehicle but his exit in the parking lot was blocked. At that point he produced a handgun and the officers were forced to take his life,"" said Chief Steve Mimbs of the Melbourne Police Department.

None of the six officers who fired their weapons at the car were injured and it was not immediately known if McDaniel was able to fire off a shot.

""They were forced to make a split second decision … this is a tragic event,"" he said of the shooting now being independently investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

The scene of the officer-involved shooting in Melbourne on Monday, June 8, 2015. Video by J.D. Gallop.

Dashboard camera footage released by Melbourne Police Department shows officers pulling into the parking lot behind a white sedan to block it in about 11:35 p.m. Sunday.

Plainclothes officers are seen getting out of an unmarked car and then getting back in, and radio recordings indicate they believed the suspect was going to flee on foot.

The video then shows the officers leaving their vehicles. Officers can be heard repeatedly warning the suspect offscreen to put down his gun.

A volley of gunfire can be heard as several officers fired at once. At that point, neither the officers or suspect are not visible in video.

As the shots end, the white sedan appears to roll across the parking lot behind the unmarked car until it comes to a stop against a streetlight, sending the pole wobbling.

The six officers were placed on administrative leave with pay, a routine move during officer-related shooting investigations.

Melbourne police search for robbery suspect

Police believe McDaniel, who records show has a history of property crimes and a recent domestic violence-related arrest, acted alone in a string of robberies that began June 2 with a heist at a CVS pharmacy. Several of the stores held up captured images of McDaniel carrying out the robberies. ""He wasn't really trying to hide himself,"" said Cmdr. Dan Lynch, showing a surveillance photo taken during a recent heist.

Police believe McDaniel may be responsible for up to five armed hold-ups that took place in less than two weeks.

McDaniel's death came months after Palm Bay police charged him with battery and petit theft in a Dec. 4 incident where he was suspected by his wife of taking a television set meant as a Christmas gift for his son and attempting to pawn it, reports show.

Police said he also took his wife's purse in a search for credit cards during the same incident. His wife, suffering from cancer and other medical conditions hid in the bathroom during the incident but police said McDaniel kicked the door down, screaming. The couple had gone to court for a divorce and his wife told officers that McDaniel, who was employed in the heart cauterization lab at Sebastian Medical Center in Indian River County, had been struggling with drugs, records show. His employment at the Sebastian Medical Center ended in December, a hospital spokeswoman said.

Melbourne police also arrested McDaniel on New Year's Eve following an investigation into over $30,000 in property missing from his parents' home. He was charged with dealing in stolen property and giving false verification of ownership of the stolen items to pawn shops.

Palm Bay police searching for armed robbery suspect

Shortly after the robbery spree began earlier this month in Melbourne, officers began looking at McDaniel as a suspect and kept him under surveillance. Sunday, he was again under surveillance following an armed robbery at a nearby Chevron gas station. Melbourne police had responded to the same area Sunday after a man walked into a Chevron gas station and pulled out a handgun on a clerk. The robber, described as thin and wearing a red shirt, reached into the register and pulled out about $600 before fleeing to the back of the store. Police arrived within minutes and brought out a police dog to help track the suspect.

By Monday morning, crime scene investigators had spent the night taking photos inside the car and marking dozens of bullet casings on the pavement. McDaniel's body was removed from the car and turned over to the medical examiner's office in Rockledge.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is talking to witnesses, family members and others while also gathering evidence in the case. It was the third fatal police-related shooting to take place in Brevard County this year, authorities said.

Sunnyvale: Authorities identify man fatally shot after reportedly charging officers with knife
SUNNYVALE -- Police fatally shot a man who reportedly charged at officers with a knife at an apartment complex early Thursday afternoon, according to the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety.

Officers were called just after noon to the Palms Villa Apartments in the 1200 block of Ayala Drive after a woman called to report anattack, Sunnyvale Capt. Jeffrey Hunter said.

Hunter said the officers were confronted by a man carrying a knife, who soon charged at them. Three officers opened fire at close range, wounding the man. He was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

No officers were injured. Hunter later confirmed that the man who was shot and the woman who called police are related and said the initial call to police was ""related to a sexual assault that occurred between the two."".


A nearby resident told this newspaper that around noon, neighbors heard a burst of four to five gunshots in ""very quick succession,"" with some initially thinking it might have been firecrackers because of the rapidness of the sounds. No other gunfire was heard.

The resident, who asked not to be named out of privacy concerns, said that it was at least half an hour after the shots were heard that they saw a large man being carried away from the scene on a gurney, as police and emergency personnel performed CPR and other live-saving measures.

Some neighbors reported hearing a loud argument before the shooting, but it was not clear whether it was related to the police encounter.

The resident also said no evacuations were ordered and that the mood of the crime scene suggested that there was no further threat to either police or the public.

The shooting marked Sunnyvale's fourth officer-involved shooting of the year, three of which were fatal. Three of the shootings involved Sunnyvale police and the fourth involved Santa Clara police.

This was also the third office-involved shooting in the Bay Area this week. On Monday, San Jose police officers shot and killed a man who had held a woman hostage at a home in the Cambrian Park neighborhood. On Wednesday, San Francisco police shot and killed a man who had climbed to the top of a construction site adjacent to St. Luke's Hospital with a loaded shotgun and fired at least one shot to the street below. All three officer-involved shootings this week have been fatal.

SUNNYVALE (CBS SF) — An armed man shot by officers at his Sunnyvale home Thursday afternoon has died, a Department of Public Safety spokesman said.

Around 12:15 p.m., three officers attempted to contact the man at his apartment in the 1200 block of Ayala Drive near South Bernardo Avenue, public safety Capt. Jeff Hunter said.

Investigating officers told KPIX 5 that a woman inside the apartment was the victim of sexual battery by her half-brother. When they tried to talk to the man, he came at them with a knife.

“The three officers used their department weapons to fire at the suspect at close range. The subject was struck, and transported to a local hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased,” Hunter said.

Police said the three officers fired at the man, shattering a glass door.

None of the officers were injured, Hunter said.

The man killed was identified by the sheriff's office as Brett Kelby Noblitt, 25, of Dalton. The suspect may have tried to elude officers due to having outstanding warrants at the time of the incident, Chitwood said.

The suspect was shot and killed by officers when he attempted to run over an officer with his vehicle.

Four deputies were in pursuit of the man who was driving a suspected stolen car. The shooting happened at Maddox Mill Road and Highway 52 at about noon.

The sheriff’s office contacted the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to assist in the investigation per departmental policy. The two officers that fired their weapons have been placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation per departmental protocol. Chitwood did not release the names of the deputies.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigations is now conducting their own investigation into the officer-involved shooting Monday in Whitfield County. 

The incident took place near the intersection of GA Highway 52 and Maddox Mill Road.

""They tried to pin him in against the rail, he got away, come down behind us here, was doing some circling around and this and that, trying to out run the cops,"" Williams said.

Steve Williams was heading out on his lunch break when he saw police chasing a Jeep Cherokee down Maddox Mill road. He says the driver of the jeep crashed into a guard rail, leaving tire marks as he tried to escape.

The chase ended once the jeep pulled off the road near a barn. Deputies surrounded him.

""He was stopped. the vehicles was surrounding him, the officers was off in the ditch had his weapon drawn,"" Williams said.

But Sheriff Chitwood says the chase wasn't over. The driver revved his engine and started moving toward the deputies.

""At that point the suspect then started the chase over, what appeared to be and attempted to run the officer over at that point, stepping to the side he did discharge his firearm,"" Sheriff Chitwood said.

Deputies shot and killed 25-year-old Brent Noblitt. The Sheriff says he may have eluded officers because he has outstanding warrants for his arrest.

The Sheriff says the two deputies who fired their weapons have been place on paid administrative leave.

D.A. Bert Poston says the fatal shooting of 25-year-old Brett Kelby Noblitt by Whitfield County Sheriff's deputies on November 16, 2015 was justified.

The shooting happened after a car chase.

""The investigation was conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigations and the undisputed facts establish that the officers’ actions were legally justified,"" Poston says in a release sent to Channel 3. 

Poston says members of Mr. Noblitt’s family have been consulted multiple times throughout this process. He says the family was ""briefed earlier this week and provided with a complete copy of the investigation.""  

The release says the District Attorney’s investigation of the case has ended.

Sheriff Scott Chitwood tells Channel 3, “I’m pleased with the outcome and we’re moving forward.”

Channel 3 reached out to the family of Brett Noblitt. His brother Franky Ward sent us the following statement:

""I would like to start my statement by saying I loved my brother more than anyone can comprehend. I would have taken a bullet for him and still would,"" Ward tells Channel 3. ""I don't blame him for not stopping because if he did, he wouldn't have gotten his two babies back from our corrupt government. Second of all, he never rammed any police cars. I have the truth to prove it. And finally, the officer that was supposedly in front of the Jeep was not, and I can prove that, too.""

Detectives are reviewing surveillance video showing what they described as a violent clash involving two men and a SEPTA police officer early Monday morning at a Market-Frankford Line station in Kensington.
The altercation ended with the SEPTA officer using his Taser to subdue one man, who later died at a local hospital, authorities said.

Police are now trying to determine who the dead man is and what killed him. Officials say the surveillance video, taken at the Huntingdon El stop, at Kensington Avenue and Huntingdon Street, about 2 a.m., shows the officer escorting the suspect out. The suspect then starts to argue with another man and the officer intervenes, according to officials. A struggle ensues and the officer uses his Taser to subdue the suspect, investigators said.
Police said the suspect, who remained a John Doe Monday afternoon, was unresponsive when he arrived at the hospital and was later pronounced dead.

SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel released part of the surveillance video showing the officer subduing the suspect during a press conference Monday afternoon.
Chief Nestel said the officer, a 5-year veteran who works the midnight shift, was shutting down the Huntingdon El station at the time of the encounter. The officer suffered bite marks and bruises during the scuffle, according to Nestel. He was taken to the hospital and treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Nestel said the officer has never had an excessive force complaint against him during his career.

POSTED: October 28, 2015
A man who was escorted out of a Market-Frankford Line station early Monday died minutes after he got into a fight with a SEPTA police officer who used a Taser to subdue him, transit officials said Monday.

Pending the results of an autopsy, it is unclear how the man died, SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel III said during an afternoon news conference.

The man, described as in his mid-20s, remained unidentified Monday night. The Philadelphia Police Department's Homicide Unit will investigate the death.

Just before 2 a.m., a security camera at the Huntingdon Station captured a SEPTA officer escorting the man onto the street.

The interaction was at first unremarkable, Nestel said. The man and the officer walked side by side past turnstiles and down the stairs to the street.

But outside, the man got into ""a heated verbal argument"" with another man on the street, Nestel said.

""The other person was feeling threatened, and the officer could see it, so he intervened,"" Nestel said.

That's when the man ""turned on"" the officer, Nestel continued. Video shows the two struggling and wrestling on the ground.

At one point, the man bit the officer, who was four inches shorter and 30 pounds lighter, Nestel said. The video did not capture the entire fight.

At 1:56 a.m., the officer called for backup but did not respond for the next eight minutes as SEPTA radio operators tried to figure out where he was.

In the interim, the officer used his Taser directly on the suspect, Nestel said. He said police did not yet know where on the man's body the officer applied the Taser.

The first backup car arrived at 2:04. A minute later, officers reported that the situation was under control, and the man, who was conscious, was placed inside a squad car, Nestel said.

At 2:16, the squad car left for a hospital, standard procedure after someone has had a Taser used on them.

Nestel said it was unclear what the officers had been doing between 2:04 and 2:16. He said that the officers may have been speaking to the other man in the dispute, or reporting to a supervisor.

On the two-minute ride from the station to Aria Health-Frankford Campus, the man became unresponsive, Nestel said. He was pronounced dead at 2:54 at the hospital.

Nestel said he ""couldn't guess"" what caused the man's death. He did not name the officer involved.

SEPTA cops have been issued Tasers for the last two years, and train at least once a year on their use. The department tracks and investigates every use of a Taser, Nestel said.

This year, transit officers have deployed their Tasers 55 times, Nestel said. An additional 119 times, they drew their Tasers from their holsters and used them as a warning, but did not fire them.

Police continue to investigate how a routine ""suspicious circumstances"" call escalated to a deadly standoff in the kitchen of a Loveland restaurant late Monday.

Emergency radio communications show fewer than six minutes passed between the initial report of a man throwing his bicycle into Eisenhower Boulevard traffic and when officers shot suspect William Rippley, who died later at an area hospital.

Rippley, a 45-year-old Loveland resident, was fatally shot in the abdomen by Loveland Police Officer Jennifer Hines. Larimer County Coroner James Wilkerson released Rippley's identity Tuesday, the same day that Loveland police identified officers involved in the shooting.

ORIGINAL STORY: Officer-involved shooting in Loveland leaves one man dead

Hines, a 10-year LPD veteran assigned to the department's patrol division, and officers Greg Harris and Jay Smith have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation of the incident. LPD said Hines is the only officer who discharged a weapon in the shooting that killed Rippley, while Harris and Smith were in close proximity at the time.

The Larimer County District Attorney's Office will conduct the investigation into Hines' use of force.

Officers were first dispatched to an area along East Eisenhower Boulevard near Mountain Lion Drive about 8 p.m. Monday on the disturbance call. Once officers in marked vehicles arrived, the suspect, later identified as Rippley, fled on foot into the kitchen of the nearby Pizza Ranch restaurant.

Inside the restaurant, officers confronted the barricaded suspect, who police say was armed with at least one knife and grabbed a patron of the restaurant as officers worked to clear people from the building. At that point, Hines fatally shot Rippley, ending the brief standoff.

Emergency medical crews descended on the scene and called for a trauma team activation at Medical Center of the Rockies, where Rippley later died.

Neither the patron grabbed by Rippley nor officers involved suffered injury.

The three officers will remain on leave during the initial investigation into Hines' use of force in the incident. Further information about the incident will be released when it is available and appropriate, according to LPD.

Anyone who saw Rippley when he was in the median of Eisenhower at about 8 p.m. Monday is asked to call the Loveland Police Department at 970-962-2217.

The Larimer County District Attorney said a Loveland police officer was justified in fatally shooting a man clutching a knife at a crowded Loveland restaurant after he warned other restaurant patrons of a ""human sacrifice.""

Officer Jennifer Hines, a 10-year veteran with Loveland police, fired one shot from her .45-caliber handgun, killing 45-year-old William Rippley.

""He is going to kill him, he had a knife in his hand, and he hadn't dropped it after hearing commands, and I just thought he is going to kill that man and it is not going to happen in front of me,"" she said. ""I drew my gun and I reached over the wall and I shot him.""

Hines and a police trainee, Jay Smith, were traveling west on Eisenhower Boulevard while on patrol Aug. 31 when they heard dispatchers report multiple 911 calls of someone throwing a bicycle into oncoming traffic. As the pair arrived at the scene near Mountain View High School in east Loveland, they saw a man, later identified as Rippley, running through a field.

Smith gave chase on foot while Hines parked the car near the Pizza Ranch. After losing sight of Rippley, officers began combing the parking lot. Moments later they saw Rippley ""leaning out the drive-up window screaming at the officers,"" District Attorney Cliff Riedel wrote in a letter to Police Chief Luke Hecker. The restaurant was open for business, and police saw Rippley walk out of the kitchen while carrying a knife.

Hines started pounding on the glass window, urging people to leave the restaurant.

Police moved to the front entrance and tried to usher diners to safety while additional officers responded. As Hines entered the restaurant, she reported seeing Rippley on the other side of a 5-foot partition, ""chest-to-back with an old man in front of him.""

Other officers who entered the restaurant from the kitchen entrance corroborated Hines' recollection of the event.

Officer Greg Harris saw Rippley moving toward an elderly man with the knife ""blade up"" in his hand. That's when Harris yelled ""hostage,"" but nobody else had a clear shot. Officer Tim Yunger approached the elderly man and tried to pull him away from Rippley, simultaneously kicking him in the thigh to slow him down, Riedel wrote in his report.

Immediately after the kick, Hines fired the single shot, striking Rippley in abdomen.

A witness later told police Rippley went into the nearby Golden Corral earlier that night — with his bicycle — and said, ""Attention everybody. I met God tonight, and the chief of police drugged me... Everyone needs to go home. Nobody is safe. Especially women and children need to leave, because there is going to be a human sacrifice tonight.""

Had he survived, Rippley could have been charged with multiple felonies including menacing and attempted first-degree assault, Riedel wrote.

""Attacks on innocent civilians in schools, theaters, churches and businesses have become all too common. Since the tragic events at Columbine High School unfolded, law enforcement officials have learned that they must immediately place themselves at risk to protect the innocent,"" Riedel wrote.

""The selfless actions of Officer Hines and the other officers at the Pizza Ranch were authorized under Colorado law and very likely prevented the loss of life to innocent civilians and employees who were in the Pizza Ranch Restaurant.""

The other officers were cleared of any wrongdoing earlier this month.

Palo Alto police investigating officer-involved shooting
PALO ALTO -- Officers shot and killed a person who allegedly charged at them with a knife Christmas night, according to a spokesman for the police department.

Police received a report around 9:16 p.m. that a person at a residence on the 600 block of Forest Avenue was threatening to harm others with a knife, Palo Alto police Sgt. James Reifschneider told The Daily News.

Gunfire erupted around 9:23 p.m., moments after officers arrived at the scene, according to Reifschneider.

""The preliminary investigation shows that almost immediately after our officers arrived on scene, a single suspect who was armed with a knife in his hand charged at our officers and shots were fired,"" he said.

 
(Palo Alto Police Department)
Medics treated the person at the scene and transported him to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, according to Reifschneider.

No officers were injured.

The identities of the officers involved in the shooting and the person who was killed were not released Friday night. Likewise, details about what triggered the incident, the type of knife used and the number of shots fired were not available.

""At this point,"" Reifschneider said, ""we're still sorting out exactly what happened and who did what.""

Officers who are involved in shootings are typically placed on administrative leave, according to Reifschneider.

""Physically, they were not injured,"" he said about the officers. ""But, as you might imagine, because this is an infrequent occurrence and something that police officers seek to avoid, it is a stressful and traumatic thing for them as well. So, we're making sure they're OK.""

Meanwhile, investigators with the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office are conducting an investigation, as is standard in any officer-involved shooting, according to Reifschneider.

""They work alongside and in parallel with our own investigators just to make sure that everything is being done thoroughly,"" he said.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the city's 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413.

San Francisco police are investigating separate stabbings over the weekend in the Mission District and Chinatown that left two men wounded, including one with life-threatening injuries.
Palo Alto police shot and killed a person Friday night after officials said the person — armed with a knife — charged at officers who were responding to what apparently were fabricated reports of a disturbance near downtown.
Police started receiving calls about the disturbance around 9:15 p.m. at a house on the 600 block of Forest Avenue near Webster Street, officials said. But the calls were apparently a ruse to summon officers to the scene, police officials said Saturday.
A caller told police dispatchers that a person in the home was trying to hurt someone, and provided a name of the reported attacker. But no one by that name was present at the scene, police said. When investigators arrived at the home, the person, whose name and gender was not released, ran at officers with the knife. It appears the suspect was waiting for officers outside the residence, police said.
At 9:23 p.m., two officers reported shooting at the suspect, who was taken to a nearby hospital and died from the injuries, police said. Both officers, who were not identified, are currently on paid administrative leave.

The Santa Clara County district attorney’s office will conduct an investigation into the incident, officials said, alongside a separate probe by the Palo Alto Police Department.
Investigators asked anyone with information about the shooting to contact police at (650) 329-2413 or by e-mailing anonymous tips to paloalto@tipnow.org.
Those with information may also send a text message or voice mail to (650) 383-8984.

PALO ALTO -- Two Palo Alto police officers have been cleared in the fatal Christmas night shooting of a mentally ill man after he reportedly charged at them with a dinner knife, according to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office.

In addition to a written report released Tuesday, prosecutors also released a 30-second excerpt of video captured by police dashboard cameras they contend shows officers Nicolas Enberg and Zachary Wicht were justified in opening fire on 31-year-old William Raff outside Momentum for Mental Health La Selva on Forest Avenue. The encounter lasted 19 seconds.

It marks the first time the District Attorney's Office has released video of an officer-involved shooting; in previous instances, still images taken from such videos have been included in similar reports.

""The totality of the evidence leads only to the conclusion that William Raff was intent on dying at the hands of police officers on December 25, 2015,"" deputy district attorney Charles Gillingham wrote in the shooting report. ""William Raff called 911 that night to create a fake emergency and draw an armed response from the police. Raff then committed suicide by attacking the officers, who shot him in self-defense.""

Palo Alto police deferred inquiries to the District Attorney's Office and said an ongoing administrative review will examine training, tactics, policies and equipment use related to the city's first police shooting in 13 years.

""We have tremendous sympathy for the Raff family and William's friends and loved ones,"" police said in a statement. ""We are also mindful of the lasting effect this incident has had on our personnel, the independent witnesses who observed what occurred, and the staff at the transitional residential program at which Mr. Raff was a resident.""

Reached by telephone Tuesday at his home in Huntington Beach, Raff's father, Gary Raff, said the report does not produce any more clarity for him.

""I was there an hour before it happened, and I sort of understand a little bit of the confusion going on there,"" Raff said. ""But it still happened too quickly.""

Raff said he will refrain from further comment until after he has thoroughly reviewed the 31-page report.

Still, Raff called the public release of the police camera video footage ""absolutely dreadful.""

""Yikes ... I couldn't even begin to look at the video,"" Raff said. ""As you can imagine, it's difficult enough. I'm just trying to live with the situation. I would just be devastated.""

The video shows Raff running and screaming at the officers, and Raff getting within arm's reach of at least one officer when they fired their guns. A counselor who tried to coax Raff back into the house could also be heard on the video telling police that Raff was holding a ""butter knife"" and told investigators he pleaded with officers not to shoot.

Michael Haddad, an attorney who plans to sue the city in federal court on behalf of Tina Cremer, Raff's mother, objected to the ""suicide by cop"" scenario given by prosecutors.

""The police are dealing with a very small person with a mental illness who is upset and holding up a butter knife. Knowing that, reasonable officers wouldn't help him commit suicide,"" Haddad said.

The District Attorney's Office explains its rationale for releasing the video, which was posted on YouTube, in a title card that precedes the footage: ""This video is graphic and viewer discretion is advised. The District Attorney's Office tries to balance the values of privacy and transparency. Finding the right balance is important to maintain and build public trust in the criminal justice system. We are releasing this video because it was relevant to our decision.""

Enberg, who had been an officer for five years at the time, and Wicht, who had been on the job for about a year and a half, were among a group of officers called to the facility around 9:15 p.m. Dec. 25 for reports of a ""really violent"" person described as ""Andre Seal."" Only long after would authorities find out that Raff was the one who made the 911 call.

Police said as officers approached a front lawn, Raff emerged from the shadows armed with a metal table knife -- described as 9 inches long with a lightly serrated edge and tapered rounded tip -- and ignored the officers' repeated orders to drop it. As the officers backed away with their firearms trained on an erratically bouncing Raff, and a third officer readying a Taser, police say Raff charged them.

Enberg and Wicht opened fire with their service weapons while the third officer fired the Taser, police said. Raff was hit multiple times and rushed to the hospital, where he died.

In the wake of the shooting, Gary Raff objected to the use of lethal force given that his son was outgunned and outnumbered, and argued they had less-deadly options. Police argued the officers' ability to cycle through other methods was diminished as soon as Raff charged at them with the knife.

Gary Raff said his son suffered from schizoaffective disorder and had been at the Tudor-style home facility for about a week after treatment at a more restrictive facility for attempting suicide, which he had done on at least two previous occasions.

The case highlights in part why police agencies across the state, whether on their own or by recent legislative mandate, are increasingly adopting crisis-intervention training aimed at helping officers handle a growing number of police calls involving a mental health crisis. Palo Alto police said at the time that such training, while vital overall, could not have been effectively employed in the Christmas night encounter because of how rapidly it unfolded.

AUSTIN (KXAN) — Police have identified the man who was shot and killed by officers in North Austin early Sunday morning as 25-year-old Richard Munroe.

According to the Austin Police Department, officers responded to a check welfare call in the 10000 block of Golden Quail drive around 4 a.m. Dispatchers advised the officers the man was crying and making comments that indicated he might be suicidal.

Police say when they arrived at the man’s house, he opened the door with a weapon — either in his hand or in his waist band.

“Officers observed this, gave him commands, but the individual did not comply immediately,” said APD Chief of Staff Brian Manley. “Officers used a Taser, but it was ineffective. And the man went back inside.”

When the man opened the door a minute later, police say he had what appeared to be self-inflicted wounds on his arms. Officers at the scene called paramedics, but the situation escalated before they were able to get there.

“The subject then reached for his weapon instead of complying,” explained Manley. “The officers at that point fired at the suspect in fear for their safety.” Police have determined Munroe was holding a BB pistol that is a replica of police and military firearm.

Three officers fired their weapons. Officers Stephen Johnson and Matthew Murphy have been with APD for one year and Officer John Nelson has been an officer since March 2015. All three will be placed on administrative duty while the Department conducts an investigation.

“This is not anything any officer ever wants to be involved in — having to take a life. But unfortunately, our officers were put in circumstances today where that took place,” said Manley.

Less than an hour after this incident, Austin police officers were involved a second deadly shooting in Downtown Austin.",Yes,No,,No,,"http://kxan.com/2015/07/05/man-shot-and-killed-by-apd-officers-in-north-austin/ ,

9 a.m. update: Austin police offered new details about two early Sunday morning shootings — on in North Austin and one in downtown — in which three people were killed, including two people fatally shot by officers.

Assistant police Chief Brian Manley said it was still early in the investigation, but the shooting that happened at the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown appeared to be a random attack by a gunman, described to be in his 30s.

Police received a call around 4:50 a.m. Sunday about a man in the hotel lobby with a gun, Manley said. The 911 call taker could hear crying and yelling in the background, he said, and was told that a man had just shot someone.

Officers arrived at the hotel a few minutes later and confronted a gunman who was carrying a rifle, Manley said. The man ran into the hotel and officers chased him before exchanging gunfire near the hotel restaurant, he said.

The gunman was killed by police; officers found a second man dead who they think was killed by the gunman.

The officer involved in killing the gunman is a five-year veteran and has been placed on administrative leave, as is customary in police shootings, Manley said.

At about 5 a.m. Lance Flores, who was staying in the Omni Hotel overnight, was getting ready to leave when he saw a body on the lobby floor and about six police officers. One of the officers directed him back upstairs. Flores said he was in shock.

“I was just thinking, ‘What the hell,’ ” he said. “There’s a dead guy lying on the floor.”

Another guest, a woman who did not want to be identified, said the gunshots sounded like fireworks and they woke her up.

The shooting in North Austin began nearly an hour earlier around 3:50 a.m. when police were asked to respond to an area near the 10600 block of Golden Quail Drive near Kramer Lane. The 911 dispatcher described hearing from a man who sounded distraught and made comments that indicated he may have been suicidal, Manley said.

At 3:57 a.m., officers arrived in the neighborhood looking for the man, Manley said. They found him at his home around 4:10 a.m. with a weapon in his waistband, he said.

Manley said the man, who was described to be in his late 20s, refused to comply with orders from the officers demanding that he disarm. The officers had tried to subdue the man with a stun gun, Manley said, but he retreated into his home. Officers described seeing what appeared to be self-inflicted injuries to his arms, Manley said, which prompted officers to call for medical help.

When the man faced the officers again, Manley said, the officers said they saw the man reach for his weapon. He was shot and killed by the officers. The three officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, Manley said.

Earlier: Three people were killed in overnight shootings including two people shot by Austin police officers, according to preliminary reports.

At the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown at 700 San Jacinto Blvd., authorities said officers shot and killed a suspect who they said fatally wounded a hotel guest. Officials said the shooting happened in the lobby.

As police were interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence, hotel guests at the Omni said they were not allowed to leave the property.

The other shooting happened in North Austin near the 10600 block of Golden Quail Drive, south of Kramer Lane, after police were asked to check on the welfare of an individual. Authorities say that when officers arrived, a man raised a weapon at the officers, who shot and killed him.

Three Austin police officers will not be charged with the July 5 shooting death of 25-year-old Richard Munroe, who police said pointed a BB gun at an officer when they arrived at his North Austin home, a Travis County grand jury decided Friday.

The grand jury spent about 11 hours reviewing evidence, heard testimony from nine witnesses before deciding that officers John Nelson, Stephen Johnson and Matt Murphy should not face charges, the Travis County district attorney’s office said.

The shooting occurred about an hour before another fatal police shooting that day, in which an officer killed a man who opened fire in the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown.

Munroe had called 911 at 3:47 a.m. on July 5, saying that he wanted to talk with someone, officials with the DA’s office said. The 911 operator asked for Munroe’s address, but Munroe did not want to give it. The 911 operator stayed on the line with Munroe while Nelson, Johnson and Murphy attempted to find Munroe’s address. They eventually arrived at Munroe’s home in the 10600 block of Golden Quail Drive.

As the officers approached the house, Munroe exited holding a gun, the DA’s office said. Officers ordered Munroe to drop the gun, but Munroe went back into his residence. Munroe emerged from the residence again, still holding the gun. Officers again ordered Munroe to drop the weapon, but Munroe alternately waved the gun in front of him and pointed it at his own head.

According to the DA’s office, Munroe then sat down on the front porch and put the gun in his lap. At that point, Murphy attempted to use a stun gun on Munroe, but it was ineffective. Munroe responded by pointing his gun at Murphy, the DA’s office said. Officers Nelson, Johnson and Murphy then fired at Munroe, striking him several times. Officers and paramedics rendered aid to Munroe but he died at the scene. After officers approached Munroe, they discovered that he had a BB gun.

LANCASTER — Lancaster police officers were attempting to serve an arrest warrant charging a Harrisburg man with two misdemeanor charges Tuesday when the exchange led to shots being fired.

Anthony Quinn Gomez Jr., 29,  of the 1300 block of North Third Street in Harrisburg, was fatally wounded in the exchange with city officers shortly before 12:30 p.m. Police had obtained the warrant earlier in the day, and Gomez faced one count each of terroristic threats and simple assault stemming from an alleged May 18 incident.

According to the criminal complaint filed by police, Gomez had been involved in a physical altercation with a woman the night before. The woman, who had been in a relationship with Gomez and and had a child with him, said Gomez had arrived at her East King Street home with two other men around 9:35 p.m. on Monday.

Gomez, she told police, punched her in the cheek and asked her if she was ""willing to take 'hollows' for him."" The woman told officers she took that to mean he would shoot her.

The woman tried to protect herself by shielding her body from the blows, but Gomez continued to punch, strike and kick her, she said.  Gomez then pulled a small steak knife, while yelling, ""Everybody is gonna die in this place.""

Gomez then took a black semi-automatic handgun from a backpack and began to wave the weapon around and threatened to ""leave her brains splattered all over,"" according to the complaint.

Two children were home at the time of the incident, and Gomez pushed them into a room, stating they were going to die, too, according to the documents.

One officer suffered a non-life threatening gunshot wound to the shoulder during the incident Tuesday. Officials have not released the identity of the ""senior officers"" involved but said the injured officer was fortunate the wound was not more serious.

The officer who fired the fatal shot was not the same officer who initially attempted to arrest Gomez.

Gomez's family members gathered near the scene of the shooting in the 300 block of East Walnut Street Tuesday afternoon and attempted to make sense of the incident. Gomez, they said, was a good father who had gotten mixed up in the wrong crowd.

A Lancaster city police officer continues to recover two days after being shot after deploying a Taser on a wanted man in the 300 block of East Chestnut Street.

“He is continuing to recover,” city police Lt. Todd Umstead said. “All is going as well as can be expected.”

Police don’t know when he will be able to leave the hospital.

Police will not be releasing the officer’s name or any specific details regarding his treatment out of respect for his privacy, they said.

“We extend our gratitude to the staff at Lancaster General Hospital for the excellent care and treatment they are providing,” police said Thursday on their Facebook page.

A family member said Wednesday the family does not want to release the officer’s name due to safety concerns, especially for his children.

Another officer returned gunfire during the incident, killing the man, Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon at city police headquarters.

Lancaster County Coroner  Dr. Stephen Diamantoni identified the man as 29-year-old Anthony Quinn Gomez Jr.

“He died as the result of more than one gunshot wound to the chest,” Diamantoni said after county forensic pathologist Dr. Wayne Ross conducted an autopsy Wednesday. “Manner of death is homicide.""

Gomez died quickly after he was shot, Diamantoni said. “The wounds were rapidly fatal.”

Chief Deputy Coroner Eric Bieber pronounced him dead at the scene.

Stedman said the second officer ""responded appropriately"" with the use of deadly force.

Police Chief Keith Sadler said the officer was shot in the hand and shoulder and was in ""pretty good condition"" and with his family and other officers late Tuesday afternoon at Lancaster General Hospital.

Sadler declined to release the names of the officers involved but said they are both ""seasoned veterans.""

Sadler said the deceased is from Harrisburg. Diamantoni could not immediately confirm that Wednesday.

Gomez was wanted on simple assault and terroristic threats charges stemming from an incident Monday night during which police said he beat up a woman and threatened to kill her and two young children, according to a warrant and criminal complaint.

According to a criminal complaint, Gomez wielded a steak knife and handgun during the Monday night altercation which occurred on East King Street.

Relatives said Gomez was a good person who was mixed up with the wrong crowd.

""He's not a bad kid,"" his uncle Julio Sepulveda told Pennlive.com Tuesday. ""I mean, it's just the friends he hangs with is basically the problem. I mean, all he knows is the streets, you know.""

On Tuesday, police went to an apartment at 305 E. Chestnut St. just after 12:30 p.m. after learning the suspect was there, officials said.

Officers were invited by a resident to enter the home where they came in contact with the suspect, according to Stedman.

He said the suspect failed to comply to officers' verbal commands to surrender.

At that point, one of the officers deployed a Taser on the suspect, who responded with gunfire which struck the officer, Stedman said.

The district attorney said the officer was ""incapacitated"" by the shot to the shoulder and another officer returned fire.

Police took the injured officer to the hospital in their own vehicle. Sadler said he was wearing a bullet-proof vest but was struck in an area of his upper chest that wasn't protected.

Relatives of Gomez say they want more information about the circumstances of his shooting.

""I just don't see how he came out shooting at the cops, you know,"" Sepulveda said to Pennlive.com. ""That's not like my nephew, and I've never known my nephew to do something like that.""

Gomez had a son and daughter, according to family members.

Lancaster Mayor Rick Gray said the shooting was the first time an officer had been shot in his 10 years as mayor.

Dave Campbell, a city resident, was just south of the shooting scene on Shippen Street.

Campbell said he saw officers walking behind buildings in the 300 block of East Chestnut Street. 

The officers then ran around to the front of the building. Campbell said he heard multiple gun shots fired.

Soon after, he said, several police cars came racing down Chestnut Street.

Campbell said they got out of their vehicles with assault rifles drawn and heard one officer say into his radio that an officer had been shot.

According to county property records, 305 E. Chestnut St.  - a two-story, brick rowhome - has been owned by Ronald and Rebecca Gantz of Manheim since 2005. They could not immediately be reached for comment.

Court records show Lancaster police in December 2011 arrested Gomez on a charge of possession of drug paraphernalia.

Manheim Township police arrested Gomez for drug dealing in July and September in 2012, records show.

Lancaster County President Judge Dennis Reinaker on April 30, 2013 sentenced Gomez to 23 months in prison, followed by two years of probation. He was granted parole at that time.

A Lancaster City Police officer was justified when he shot and killed a suspect who shot another officer in May, District Attorney Craig Stedman told reporters during a Friday afternoon press conference. 

An officer shot and killed Anthony Quinn Gomez Jr., 29, after Gomez shot an officer as police served a warrant on him in an apartment in the 300 block of East Chestnut Street, according to a criminal complaint filed by police. 

The officer sustained non-life threatening wounds to the hand and left shoulder. Stedman's office investigated the incident and deemed the officer who shot Gomez was justified in his actions, according to an ABC27 report. Stedman would not identify the officers involved in the incident, the report said. 

Officers went to the apartment to arrest Gomez on simple assault and terroristic threat charges stemming to a domestic dispute that allegedly occurred the day before, according to police. 

Gomez refused to surrender, and after an officer used a stun gun to subdue him, he shot the officer, according to police. That's when the other officer shot and killed Gomez, who was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. 

Gomez had a physical dispute with a woman he had been in a relationship with and had a child with, according to police. He allegedly went to her East King Street home with two other men at 9:35 p.m. on May 18.

The woman told police Gomez punched her in the face and asked her if she was ""willing to take 'hollows' for him,"" which she understood to mean he would shoot her.

Gomez continued to punch, strike and kick the woman, she told police said. He then allegedly pulled a small steak knife and yelled, ""Everybody is gonna die in this place.""

Gomez then grabbed a semi-automatic handgun and began to wave it around, police said. He allegedly told her he would ""leave her brains splattered all over,"" according to the complaint.

Two children were in the apartment at the time, and Gomez pushed them into a room, and said they would also die, according to police.

WEATHERFORD 
A patrol officer fatally shot a man who pulled a knife on paramedics and firefighters Tuesday morning inside a Western wear store, police said.

Officials with the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office identified the man as Randall Waddel, 49, of Weatherford. He was pronounced dead at 4:28 p.m. Tuesday at Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth.

The man was shot at least once and died at a Fort Worth hospital, said Cmdr. Chris Crawford, a police spokesman.

No one else was injured in the incident at David’s Western Wear, 1811 S. Main St.

“The officer arrived on the scene and was told that the man was inside the business,” Crawford said. “There was a confrontation near the front of the door, and the officer fired his weapon.”

The man fell, and the officer kicked the knife away, Crawford said. The officer and paramedics gave the man medical care before he was taken to the Fort Worth hospital.

The incident began with a medical call about 10:50 a.m. in the 1800 block of South Main Street.

“Someone called 911 to say that there was a man lying on a parking lot median,” Crawford said. “The man had been acting strangely. He had tripped and fallen.”

Paramedics and firefighters arrived and found the man still lying down. “The man continued to act strangely,” Crawford said. “The man stood up and pulled a knife out.” At some point, he walked into the store.

Police did not release information on how many times the officer fired. The officer, whose name was not released, was placed on administrative leave, which is standard policy when a Weatherford officer is involved in a shooting, Crawford said.

A man shot by Weatherford police Tuesday morning while wielding a knife in a store has died, according to the Weatherford Police Department.

Shortly after the man pulled a knife on paramedics Tuesday morning and entered a nearby store, a responding officer confronted the man and shot him, Weatherford Police Cmdr. Chris Crawford said

LifeCare and Weatherford Fire Department were dispatched late Tuesday morning to a medical call after a caller reported a man apparently stumbling and acting strangely along South Main, according to Crawford.

Paramedics found a man sitting along South Main Street.

“They were trying to assess him and talk to him and find out what it is they could help him with,” Crawford said. “During the course of that conversation, the suspect stood up ... He was not really talking to them a whole lot. And the suspect pulled a knife out on the fire department and LifeCare paramedics that were on scene.”

The paramedics backed up and immediately called for help from police, according to Crawford, who said the man then walked across the parking lot and entered David’s Western Store.

An officer arrived on scene quickly and went inside to see what the man was doing.

“After a few moments inside, the officers confronted the suspect with the knife,” Crawford said. “Shots were fired and the suspect was struck at least once.”

The man immediately went down and the knife was removed from his hand, according to Crawford, who said he understands the shooting occurred just inside the doorway of the business.

The man was given medical treatment at the scene and was alive and in serious condition when transported to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital by LifeCare, where he was rushed into surgery, according to police. The man was later pronounced dead.

Police did not release the name of the man who was shot or the officer, who was not injured.

The officer, who has been placed on administrative leave as is routine in officer-involved shootings, has been with the Weatherford police department for longer than seven years, according to Crawford.

“This incident is another example of how quickly routine calls or seemingly normal situations can turn violent and/or escalate into a life-threatening situation not just for the police officers, but for our citizens, fire and EMS personnel who were also on the scene,” Crawford said.

The Texas Rangers were contacted and are leading the investigation into the shooting, per normal department procedures, according to Crawford.

The store had reopened by late afternoon. Staff referred the Democrat to police.",Yes,No,,No,,"http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/weatherforddemocrat.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/9a/69acc3aa-19cb-11e5-a091-aff112fdd4e5/55899511e7a72.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C806  ,

The family of Randall Waddel, who was holding a knife when he was shot and killed by a Weatherford police officer in June, this week released video of the shooting, saying it shows that Waddel was attempting to flee the officer and was not threatening the officer or bystanders when he was shot. 

Waddel – who had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and was legally intoxicated at the time – was chased at gunpoint through the store and did not respond to commands from the officer to drop the knife before he was shot, according to video and witness accounts.  

“My brother walked all the way around and tried to avoid him [the officer] at all costs,” Waddel’s sister, Joyce Conner, said. “Never one time did he hold up the knife. Not one time.”

Conner said she doesn’t believe the 49-year-old Waddel behaved in a way that should have resulted in the officer shooting him. 

“He had no lawful reason to shoot my brother,” Conner said. “He [Waddel] was mentally ill and scared.” 

A grand jury declined to pursue criminal charges against 47-yerar-old Christopher Brown, an eight-year veteran of the Weatherford police force. 

Weatherford Police Chief Mike Manning said he believes Brown handled the situation appropriately.

Manning declined to discuss the specifics of the shooting because the family has indicated they plan to sue the department. 

Paramedics were initially called around 11 a.m. June 23rd to a business in the 1800 block of South Main Street, where Waddel, who was walking along South Main Street, fell in a parking lot.  

After Waddel refused to go to the hospital, paramedics, believing Waddel to be intoxicated and unfit to continue walking along the roadway, called police, according to the Texas Ranger report. 

Waddel pulled out an unopened pocket knife and pushed past the medics, witnesses said. 

As he walked towards David’s Western Store, Waddel opened the knife, the paramedics reported. 

As Waddel entered the business holding the knife behind him, several employees to fled out a back door. 

The surveillance video shows that Waddel walked behind a sales counter and stood for a moment holding the knife, head down and rocking for several seconds. 

Waddel appeared to ignore the store manager, who brushed past him unaware of what was going on, and firefighters, who followed Waddel inside and motioned towards him and the manager. 

Brown, who had been told en route that the possibly intoxicated subject was becoming combative and had a knife in his possession, then entered the business and drew his gun as he began chasing Waddel across the store. 

According to the Texas Ranger investigation report, witnesses reported that Brown repeatedly ordered Waddel to drop the knife. 

As Waddel ran down an aisle and neared the front door of the store, Brown ran in front of Waddel and shot him as Waddel neared the officer and turned toward the door, the video shows. 

Waddel was struck by the first bullet on the right side of his chest and then a second bullet that went into his side, according to the autopsy report. 

The officer said in a written statement that he believed Waddel would cut or stab him if he did not stop him. 

Texas Ranger Tony Bradford noted in his report that Waddel was shot well within 21 feet of Brown, the standard “safe” distance from a person armed with a knife, according to law enforcement training. 

Manning said officers are taught that 21 feet is the distance a typical person armed with a knife can close before an officer has the ability to react and the officer is likely to be cut. 

After viewing the surveillance video, Bradford noted that Waddel’s actions “could be interpreted by an observer to be an attempt to flee the store rather than an attempt to attack or injure Officer Brown.” 

At least one witness appeared to hold that view of the shooting, according to Bradford’s report. 

However, Bradford determined that Brown made the decision to fire while Waddel was still coming down the aisle towards him. 

Bradford also noted a prior incident in March 2015 where Waddel ran from Weatherford police while armed with a knife. Waddel was detained, put the knife away and voluntarily went to the hospital for a mental health evaluation. 

Waddel was significantly hearing impaired and had been fitted for hearing aids that week, according to family members. However, Waddel’s boss, who described Waddel as quiet, mild-mannered and “a little slow,” told Bradford that he did not notice a hearing issue while interacting with him in the previous three months. 

Waddel had previously been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital causing him to lose his home, Waddel’s brother, Richard Waddel, previously told the Democrat.

Family members speculated that Waddel may have feared authorities were going to take him away again and he would lose his job and other recent gains. 

“What I’m wanting to do is have officers better trained to deal with the mentally ill,” Conner said. 

Manning said that is something his department is currently focusing on. 

“The mental health issue is going to do nothing but get worse because of the funding cuts that occurred in mental health services,” Manning said. 

In October, the department received a state grant to provide industry-standard mental health training for peace officers. 

“It’s actually a certification provided by TCOLE [Texas Commission on Law Enforcement],” Manning said, adding that he does not know of any other department of Weatherford’s size that provides the training to that level to every sworn officer. 

By June 17 every sworn officer in the department will have completed the training, Manning said, adding that they have already made arrangements to have all officers who later join the department receive the training, as well.

Thursday, October 1, 2015
District Attorney General Neal Pinkston sent a letter Thursday to Sheriff Jim Hammond stating the deputy shooting of Brent Pickard was justified.  

Four Hamilton County deputies were originally placed on leave, pending the investigation. 

Pickard was shot Aug. 26 by county deputies after a chase ended on Highway 153.  

While sheriff’s deputies were in route to the location of the call, the suspect fled the scene in his car.  Sheriff’s deputies pursued the suspect and attempted to stop him several times, but he refused to pull over or stop. 

Sheriff’s deputies were finally able to stop the suspect in the 5900 block of Highway 153.  Once stopped, the suspect brandished a weapon at which time officers had to use deadly force to stop him.  

The letter to Sheriff Hammond stated: 

""This letter concerns the August 26, 2015 fatal shooting of Brent Pickard. 

""At the conclusion of the Chattanooga Police Department's of the investigation of the events leading up to and including the shooting of Brent Pickard, I was thoroughly briefed by the lead detective on the case.  

""I also reviewed the dash camera videos, which recorded the chase and its conclusion. 

""After considering applicable state law and the totality of the circumstances, it is my conclusion that Hamilton County Sheriff's deputies did not violate any state law.  Further their use of deadly force was justified.""

The man shot and killed by Hamilton County sheriff's deputies Wednesday night has been identified as 46-year-old Brent Pickard.

Pickard brandished a firearm at the end of a lengthy car chase Wednesday night and was killed by deputies, according to the sheriff's office.

Deputies initially responded to a report disorder with a weapon involved in the Ooltewah area at 9:30 p.m., said Gino Bennett, director of support services. As deputies were on route, the suspect fled in a vehicle and deputies gave chase.

Deputies attempted to stop the vehicle several times but the man refused to pull over, Bennett said.

Pickard was finally stopped near 5900 Highway 153, north of Hixson. At that point, he pulled out a weapon and was killed by deputies.

Four deputies have been placed on standard administrative leave, according to the sheriff's office. 

Wednesday's chase was not the first time Pickard had been involved in a standoff with police. In April 2014, Pickard threatened a woman with a rifle and then got into a four-hour standoff with police in Dalton, Ga., after he entered the business where he worked with a rifle. 

No one was injured in that incident and Pickard was charged with simple assault. Those charges were later dismissed. 

The Chattanooga Police Department will investigate Wednesday's shooting, Bennett said. Sheriff Jim Hammond said the sheriff's office will also conduct a separate, internal investigation into the event.

""We asked the city to do an independent investigation,"" Hammond said. ""That is standard procedure in a situation like this — to ask another agency to take a transparent look.""

The police department will look at whether the shooting was justified by law, Hammond said. He declined to say what type of firearm Pickard was armed with. 

CPD declined to comment on the investigation in a statement. 

""At this time it would be inappropriate for the Chattanooga Police Department to further comment or answer questions until the conclusion of the investigation to ensure information is validated,"" the statement read. 

The stretch of Highway 153 where the shooting happened was closed overnight and into the morning, which caused traffic backups in the area.

UPDATE: Man charged in Dalton standoff
HAMILTON COUNTY, TN (WRCB) -
UPDATE: District Attorney Neal Pinkston has ruled that the deputies involved in the August shooting of Brent Pickard acted properly.

In a letter sent by Pinkston to Hamilton County Sheriff Jim Hammond, Pinkston said he reviewed the dash cam videos and de-briefed the lead detective in the case.

Pinkston went further and said there were no violations of state law, and the use of deadly force was justified in the fatal shooting.

PREVIOUS STORY: We are learning more about the death of an Ooltewah man, shot by deputies following a police chase.
 
Autopsy results obtained by Channel 3 show Brent Price Pickard, 46, was shot 13 times by deputies. A medical examiner ruled his cause of death to be the result of multiple gunshot wounds.

The preliminary examination was not able to determine how far away officers were when they fired, but the report shows Pickard was hit in the head, left shoulder, torso and right arm.
 
A spokesperson for the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office officially released the names of the deputies involved on Wednesday as Sgt. Gregg Carson, Sgt. Spencer Daniels, Deputy Adam Ty Williams and Deputy Eric Baxter.
 
The four were involved with the August 26 incident that was initiated by a domestic disturbance call. Pickard led deputies on a chase that ended with a crash on Highway 153 in Hixson. Deputies say Pickard was armed and pulled his gun following the crash. That’s when they reportedly fired.  
 
All four officers were placed on mandatory administrative leave, according to department policy, and have since returned to active duty.
 
The Chattanooga Police Department is investigating the incident and has not released any further information, citing the on-going investigation.

PREVIOUS STORY: The Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office released the names of the four deputies involved in the shooting of Brent Pickard August 26, 2015 after a police chase.
 
The HCSO Deputies are:

Sgt. Gregg Carson
Sgt. Spencer Daniels
Deputy Adam Ty Williams
Deputy Eric Baxter
As per HCSO’s policy, all four deputies were placed on a mandatory administrative leave, and have since returned to active duty. 

PREVIOUS STORY: Brent Pickard, 46, of Ooltewah has been identified as the man shot and killed by Hamilton County deputies Wednesday night.

Sheriff Jim Hammond and District Attorney General Neal Pinkston have handed the investigation off to Chattanooga Police. Detectives interviewed two deputies and two sergeants overnight who were part of the incident.

""Right now it appears to be unfortunately a domestic situation that went bad and for whatever reasons, the defendant made a bad decision and the result is evident,"" said Sheriff Hammond.

The incident began with a disturbance call with a weapon at Pickard's home in Ooltewah. Police say Pickard fled the scene at a high rate of speed, taking deputies and Collegedale Police on a chase.

Authorities tried stopping his BMW with spike strips but it didn't work. After an 18 mile chase, deputies used a PIT maneuver to stop his car. That's when they say he brandished a weapon. Deputies then fired into his car, striking him multiple times and killing him on the scene.

""At this point we have no reason to believe these officers did anything other than what they were supposed to,"" Hammond said.

An eyewitness told Channel 3 she heard deputies yell at Pickard to ""put his hands up"" and ""he's got a gun."" She then lost count of how many shots were fired at the vehicle.

Pickard has a history with police. He was arrested last month for domestic assault in Hamilton County. He was due in court Monday, August 31.

Just four hours before his death, Pickard posted on Facebook: ""Frustrated beyond compare.... God is still good!!!""

In April 2014, Pickard barricaded himself in a Dalton building after a fight with his wife. He surrendered after several hours.

The case is still pending further investigation. The four deputies are on paid administrative leave, per department policy. Pickard's body is at the Hamilton County Medical Examiner's office for an autopsy.

PREVIOUS STORY: SR-153 has re-opened to traffic as the investigation winds down. 

An eyewitness tells Channel 3 what she saw during last night's chase that ended with Hamilton County deputies fatally shooting a suspect.

Deputies yelled ""Show us your hands!"" and ""He has a gun!"" and then gun shots. She lost count.

Chattanooga Police are investigating the deadly shooting shooting Wednesday night near the Academy Sports shopping center on Highway 153.

The Hamilton County Sheriff’s Department said deputies were dispatched on a disorder call with a possible weapon in the Collegedale/Ooltewah area around 9:30 that night.

The suspect left the scene in his car when deputies were en route to the location. Deputies chased the suspect and tried to stop him several times, but he refused to pull over.

The suspect crashed his car somewhere near Pine Mar Drive and Highway 153.

""Once stopped, the suspect brandished a weapon at which time officers had to use deadly force to stop him. No sheriff’s deputies were injured in this incident,"" said department spokesperson G.A. Bennett in a news release. 

PREVIOUS STORY: A car chase through Hamilton County ends in a crash and fatal officer involved shooting.

Hamilton County deputies chased the suspect from Old Lee Highway to Pine Mar Drive inside the city limits. The suspect crashed at PIne Mar and shots were fired resulting in the suspect's death.

Hamilton County District Attorney General Neal Pinkston has asked Chattanooga Police to investigate this incident.

HARRISON TOWNSHIP, Ohio -- A 34-year-old black man is dead after a deputy-involved shooting in Harrison Township, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office.

WHIO-TV reported that the shooting happened early Thursday in the 300 block of Springbrook Drive.

Officials said deputies were dispatched to the scene after getting calls that a driver struck a parked vehicle in a driveway.

The Sheriff’s Office said a 911 caller told dispatchers they didn’t see anyone exit the vehicle that hit the parked car after the crash.

According to WHIO, the deputies who made contact with the driver said he displayed a handgun. The deputies said they shot at the driver and he was struck by the gunfire.

The driver was taken to Grandview Medical Center where he later died.

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference is calling for a grand jury to hear a case involving the shooting death of Dontae Martin at the hands of two deputies.

KEY POINTS

Martin was shot July 23 on darkened Springbrook Boulevard
Local SCLC calling for grand jury to hear case
Deputies Gust Teague, Josh Haas had ordered him to drop pistol
Sheriff: Pistol, loaded with “cop-killer” ammo, was pointed at them
UPDATE @ 8:52 p.m. (Sept. 15): The deputy-involved fatal shooting of Dontae Martin is a step closer to being heard by a grand jury, Montgomery County Sheriff Phil Plummer said.

The sheriff’s office recently received the county coroner’s report, which was needed in order to have the case presented to a grand jury, he said.

News of the report came the same day a group of about 40 that included Martin’s family members, friends and community leaders gathered at the county administration building on West Third Street to rally for justice in the aftermath of his death.

“We are here to let the county commission know that we don’t want them to continue to ignore the fact that the sheriff’s (deputies) allegedly killed Dontae Martin and we’re still angry about it,” said Bishop Richard Cox of the Dayton area SCLC.

He said the group was asking the commissioners to look into what the group feels is systemic racism occurring in the sheriff’s office.

“When this goes before a grand jury, we want an indictment on these (deputies) for allegedly killing (Martin),” Cox said.

UPDATE @1:45 p.m. (Aug. 26):

Bishop Richard Cox, president of the Dayton chapter of the SCLC, said today he plans to bring his concerns to the next county commission meeting.

UPDATE @ 7:45 p.m. (Aug. 5):

The mother of the man shot to death by two Montgomery County sheriff’s deputies last month has filed a complaint with the Dayton Unit NAACP, organization President Derrick Foward said.

Patricia Martin filed the complaint Tuesday, Aug. 4, relating to the death of Dontae Martin, Foward said in a prepared statement.

“We have been in contact with the family Attorney[sic] Michael Wright as well as [Montgomery County] Coroner Ken Betz and stand ready and have taken the appropriate steps to ensure that a thorough and complete investigation will be conducted,” Foward said in the statement.

“The bottom line is, ‘If It Ain’t Right, You Must Indict,’ ” Foward said in the statement.

UPDATE @ 8:30 p.m. July 29:

The attorney representing the family of Dontae Martin and a local civil rights leader Wednesday questioned the Montgomery County sheriff’s account of what led to the shooting death of the 34-year-old at the hands of two deputies.

“There are multiple questions this family needs to be answered. Was Dontae targeted? How many contacts did these two officers have with Dontae prior to this fatal shooting?” Michael Wright of Wright & Schulte asked at a news conference.

He was surrounded by Bishop Richard Cox, president of the Dayton chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and members of Martin’s family.

Wright also questioned why deputies did not turn on the overhead lights of their cruiser after responding on a 911 call and on a dark street during the early morning hours of July 23.

Wright’s questions came six days after Sheriff Phil Plummer said at his news conference that no audio or video existed because “it’s not protocol” to use lights and sirens in response to a one-vehicle crash. The use of lights and sirens activates audio and visual recording.

“Why did the officers respond to this call and not have their overhead lights on? We know that when the overhead lights are not on, the dash cam is not operating,” Wright said.

Plummer’s office, reached after the Martin family news conference, declined to respond to the questions.

Plummer has said deputies recovered a 20-round, FN Five-seveNCQ semiautomatic pistol after the shooting he said occurred when deputies Gus Teague and Joshua Haas ordered Martin several times to drop the weapon after they approached the vehicle he was driving.

Teague and Haas came in contact with Martin, who Plummer said might have been intoxicated, after responding to a 911 call that a woman had placed about a vehicle that had driven off the side of Springbrook Boulevard and into another car that was parked in a driveway.

“We’re approaching the vehicle thinking it’s a single-car crash, so we’re there to help the guy” Plummer said at his news conference. “As they approach the car and they look in closely with the flashlight, the gun is pointed at them, so immediately, it escalates into a deadly force situation.”

Martin, a fiancé and father of six children, was pronounced dead at 1:34 a.m. at Grandview Medical Center.

“Dontae Martin died from multiple gunshot wounds originating from opposite sides of his vehicle,” said Ken Betz, director of the county coroner’s office.

Teague and Haas are on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

Plummer also said Martin was a felon.

“We believe that the sheriff has told us a lie. We believe that the sheriff deliberately said bad things about Dontae to cover up for the officers that murdered him,” Cox said.

Montgomery County Common Pleas records show that Martin received intervention in lieu of conviction for a 2007 felony case in which he was charged with possession of cocaine and heroin. This newspaper’s background search on Martin showed that most of Martin’s documented interaction with law enforcement had been traffic-related.

“This community and SCLC is upset because (the sheriff’s office) painted a bad picture of Dontae,” Cox said.

Wright said Martin was shot in the head and from behind. He added that none of the witnesses said they saw Martin with a gun.

“So why was he shot and killed?” he asked.

Chief Deputy Rob Streck declined to address those statements.

“We’re in the middle of the investigation now. We have the criminal part to go through, the internal part. We’re not going to make any statements right now other than what the sheriff’s already made,” Streck said.

Haas was involved in a shooting late last year. A Montgomery County grand jury returned a “no true bill,” meaning it found no probable cause to charge him for shooting James A.

Calvon Reid writhed in pain before he died. “I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe,” the 39-year-old screamed. Reid, an African American father of two, was held face-down by two police officers on a grassy lawn inside a predominantly white, gated retirement village in the south Florida suburb of Coconut Creek in the early hours of 22 February.

 Calvon ‘Andre’ Reid
 Calvon ‘Andre’ Reid.
Moments before, two officers, standing 10ft away, had deployed their weapons in tandem. Not guns, but Tasers. The barbs struck Reid in the chest, according to eyewitnesses, unleashing 50,000-volt shocks to his body. Reid stopped breathing within moments; two days later, he died in the hospital.

“The whole thing seemed brutal,” 58-year-old locksmith John Arnendale told the Guardian from the ground-floor apartment at Wynmoor Village retirement homes where he watched Reid lose consciousness for the last time.

It is not clear why the officers were trying to arrest Reid in the first place. He was not accused of any crime. Though police say he was acting aggressively, other witnesses have disputed this.

“They didn’t have to use a Taser to stop him,” Arnendale said. “There were four of them and he wasn’t huge or particularly athletic. They certainly didn’t choose the least harsh thing to do with him. They were kind of punishing him.”

While deadly police shootings in the United States have gained international attention this year, Reid is one of 47 lesser-known people who lost their lives after law enforcement officers deployed a Taser, according to The Counted, an ongoing Guardian investigation documenting fatalities that follow police encounters.

Reid’s case is, in many ways, tragically typical of the other deaths following the use of a Taser by police in 2015: he was unarmed, as in all but three cases. Like nearly 40% of the victims, he was black. And as in at least 53% of such cases, the suspect was displaying signs of intoxication before his or her death. As with many of these incidents, Reid died following shocks administered seemingly in violation of national guidelines, by officers belonging to a police department with lax rules on how these less-lethal weapons should be used.

As Tasers became an increasingly prevalent part of police officers’ arsenals around the world, the US Justice Department funded the Police Executive Research Forum (Perf), an independent policing thinktank, to revise guidelines on their use in 2011. These rules are designed to encourage officers to know Tasers “should not be seen as an all-purpose weapon that takes the place of de-escalation techniques” – and to acknowledge the lethal potential of electronic control weapons (ECW) deployed for more than three standard shock cycles of five seconds each.

“When Tasers were first introduced, it was thought they really could be used without causing any harm,” Perf executive director Chuck Wexler said in a phone interview. “Subsequently, in our research and work, we realised that extended use of ECWs could cause injuries and death. That is why we stipulate restrictions on their use.”

The Guardian can now reveal that many police departments are still not regulating the use of Tasers in accordance with these nationally accepted standards. According to 29 guidebooks on ECWs obtained by the Guardian from police departments where a death has occurred after the weapon was deployed this year, an overwhelming majority of them flout key tenets of the expert advice:

Twenty police departments do not guide officers against more than three shocks in all but exceptional circumstances.
None of the 29 departments, according to their use of force guidelines, mandate use-of-force investigations into incidents where an ECW is deployed for more than 15 seconds.
Twenty-two departments do not advise against deploying ECWs if the sole justification is that the suspect is fleeing.

Man, 26, dies after he was shocked with deputy's Taser during confrontation
A 26-year-old man who was shocked with a Taser Tuesday night during a confrontation with sheriff's deputies in Willowbrook has died, authorities said.

Soon after being shocked by a deputy’s Taser, Brian Pickett of Los Angeles stopped breathing and was taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Pickett’s mother had called deputies about 9:20 p.m. to report that her son was under the influence and that he had threatened her life, authorities said.

Deputies went to a home in the 1600 block of East 123rd Street and approached Pickett. Pickett’s mother told deputies that he was refusing to leave, sheriff’s officials said.

Authorities said Pickett become “agitated and hostile” when he saw deputies and charged at them.

A deputy used his Taser to subdue Pickett, who was then handcuffed.

Paramedics arrived at the scene to remove the Taser darts from the man’s body and he stopped breathing.

State officials in Mississippi are investigating the death of an unarmed black man who was killed in a physical struggle with a police officer while saying “I can’t breathe”, according to his attorney.

Jonathan Sanders suffered “some kind of asphyxiation” during an altercation with white officer Kevin Harrington on Wednesday night, in the small town of Stonewall, in the eastern part of the state, said the attorney, J Stewart Parrish.

Sanders, 39, was a father of two children including a one-year-old, according to his family.

Parrish told several local media outlets that Harrington pulled Sanders from a horse and choked him to death with a flashlight. Parrish told the Guardian on Friday that allegation had come from relatives who live beside the site of the struggle and witnessed it.

But Stonewall police chief Michael Street denied the details of the attorney’s allegations, telling the Guardian the two men engaged in “a fight” without weapons after Sanders voluntarily stepped down from a horse-drawn buggy.

“We won’t know until the autopsy is over what was the actual cause of death,” said Street. “But there was no flashlight used to choke anybody – that’s false. And there were no shots fired by either man, there were no weapons at all, and he was not dragged off a horse.”

Parrish described the chief’s denial as “a difference without a distinction” because Sanders “was choked to death”, according to the relatives. “Towards the end of the incident, he was telling the officer ‘Let me go, I can’t breathe,” Parrish said they had recalled.

The attorney, who is a former law enforcement officer, said Harrington appeared to have used excessive force. “Officers typically have Tasers, they have pepper spray – there are lots of different non-lethal ways to subdue somebody,” he said. “And one way, of course, is to walk away and come back with more officers.”

Friends and relatives of Sanders have embarked on a campaign demanding “Justice for Jonathan”, displaying a flyer that shows Sanders riding a horse on social media accounts. A community horse ride is being planned as a tribute.

“Please continue praying for me and my family as we so desperately need,” his mother, Frances Sanders, said in a post to Facebook.

Street has asked the Mississippi bureau of investigation (MBI) to look into the incident. He declined to specify why Harrington stopped Sanders. “But there’s no lighting on a horse carriage, and at 10.30 at night that’s ... well I can’t discuss that further,” he said in a telephone interview.

Warren Strain, a spokesman for the MBI, said in an email that state investigators and forensic technicians attended the scene. “Since the investigation is ongoing there is little we can say at this point,” said Strain.

Parrish said Sanders’s family insisted his buggy did have lights. Witnesses said the officer first stopped a man in a car who had just driven up beside Sanders’s buggy, according to Parrish. He then let this man go and pursued Sanders instead.

“He was asking ‘Why do you stop me? What are you hassling me for?’,” Parrish said the witnesses had recounted. “He pulled him off the buggy, and they went to the ground, and it went from there.”

The police chief said Sanders had no active warrants against him and that Harrington did not know who he was when the confrontation took place.

Parrish said he was already representing Sanders because the 39-year-old was out on bond for a charge of possessing a small amount of cocaine earlier this year. The attorney said Sanders appeared relatively fit and healthy.

Both Harrington and a medic gave CPR to Sanders, according to Street, before he was taken to a hospital in an ambulance. His body has been transferred to Jackson, about 100 miles to the west, for a full autopsy, according to authorities.

Asked whether the officer was injured in the encounter, Street would only say Harrington was released after being taken to hospital for a procedural checkup and drug test. Harrington has been placed on leave from work for an unspecified period, according to the chief. “With everything going on right now, we thought that was best,” he said.

Street said it was not clear whether Sanders acted aggressively. “At this point we’re not sure,” he said. “It would be premature for me to make any assumption on what Mr Sanders did or did not do.” He confirmed Sanders was unarmed.

The police chief also declined to detail where the incident happened. “All we can say is that it was within the Stonewall city limits around 10.30pm,” he said.

Stonewall is home to only 1,144 people, according to 2013 US census bureau data, which found that 77% of residents were white and 23% were black. Almost 29% of families in the town had incomes below the poverty line.

The town was established in Clarke County in the years after the American civil war and was named after General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, a senior commander in the confederate army, according to the state department of archives and history.

Street said his department is composed of 10 part-time officers – nine white and one black. He said one of the white officers was a woman and the other nine officers were men. “So we’re kind of diverse,” he said.

Street said he expected that the results of the MBI’s inquiry would be put to a Clarke County grand jury for the consideration of criminal charges.

The police chief appealed people to remain calm while the inquiry was carried out. “We don’t need anything being taken out into the street,” he said. “Our community is a good community. We don’t see any issues there. We are going to continue our good relationship.”",Yes,Yes,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436550775444/90b1c1d3-1d0d-49c9-9062-88e19513cfdf-620x372.jpeg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=6ebd58187aa02df99d0cb9593e4e17b6,No,,NONE,http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2015/07/10/death-involving-stonewall-miss-officer-investigated/29952949/,"Police: Incident between horseman, officer ends in death","Police: Incident between horseman, officer ends in death

Authorities are looking into a Wednesday night death involving a Stonewall police officer.

Stonewall Police Chief Michael Street said Jonathan Sanders, 39, died between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. Wednesday night, after a fight with a police officer.

Attorney Stewart Parish, who was Sanders' attorney and is acting as a spokesperson for the family, said that witnesses have told him Sanders was exercising his horse Wednesday night when he ran into a friend and had a conversation. At the end of the discussion the friend went to the Cefko gas station.

It's unclear where Sanders was when he called his friend's brother and said, ""You might want to go check on your brother, the cops are harassing him at the Cefko.""

Sanders was driving a buggy being pulled by a horse, Parish said, and he headed into a subdivision which had two entries which made a loop. Parish said Sanders went down one entrance and the officer, Kevin Herrington, went down the other. At some point when Sanders saw Herrington coming toward him, Parish said he pulled into his cousin's yard. Parish said Herrington got out with Sanders in that yard.

""We don't know why he was going after Jonathan, we don't know what the reason for stopping him was, we don't know what led up to this incident,"" Parish said, adding that he hasn't been able to talk to all the eyewitnesses yet.

That's when an altercation occurred. Details of that are sketchy by all accounts. Early reports had Herrington using a flashlight to strangle Sanders, but both Street and Parish have since said there was no flashlight.

Parish said as far as he knows, Sanders did not have a weapon, but that Sanders ended up strangled to death.

Street said the actual interaction that led to the altercation is part of the ongoing investigation. He wasn't able to elaborate much.

""It was at night and he didn't really know who he was dealing with at first,"" Street said. ""An altercation did take place between 10:30 and 11 p.m., and at our request the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation was contacted and asked to come in and perform an investigation on the whole incident so we will have complete transparency with our department and our town.""

Street said it's too early in the investigation to even comment on any of the elements of the case.

""At this point there's no clarification whether choking is the actual cause of death until the autopsy is complete,"" Street said. ""At this time it would be premature for us to speculate on any of the events as they unfolded until all the witnesses have been interviewed. Law enforcement doesn't have the luxury of speculating. We deal in facts and truth, and in this instant as in any other, that's what we will do.""

Clarke County Coroner Greg Fairchild says Sanders' body has been sent to the State Crime Lab in Jackson for an autopsy. MBI spokesman Warren Strain said the autopsy should be done Friday.

""Until we get all the findings back from that, it's too early to talk about it,"" Strain said.

Stonewall is a town of 1,100, and Sanders had crossed paths with authorities before. Circuit Clerk Beth Jordan said Sanders was out on bond from an April arrest for possession of cocaine, and that he had been convicted on charges of sale of cocaine in 2003.

MDOC Communications Director Grace Fisher said Sanders was given five years to serve with five years probation. He was released on May 23, 2007.

Sanders' arrest record also shows arrests dating back to 2001 for disturbance of the family peace, sale of a counterfeit substance, domestic violence, and some traffic violations.

Herrington, who Street said has never received any complaints of abuse of force or even any written complaints for anything else, is on administrative leave with pay as is routine in such a case.

 The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is stepping in to investigate an incident in Stonewall where a man died after an altercation with a police officer.
Stonewall, Miss. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is stepping in to investigate an incident in Clarke County where a man died after an altercation with a police officer.

Clarke Co. coroner Greg Fairchild confirms 39-year-old Jonathan Sanders died Wednesday night. Sanders' attorney, Stewart Parish, tells Newscenter 11 that Sanders was exercising his horses in Stonewall when Officer Kevin Herrington pulled him off and choked Sanders with a flashlight. Right now, Stonewall police say they can't release much information, but Chief Michael Street says an incident did happen between 10:30 and 11 p.m. when an officer encountered an individual.

""We can't really give out any particulars to it because it is an ongoing investigation. I can say that we've always had a good relation with the community, and we continue to do that,"" he says.

Sanders' girlfriend, Charita Kennedy, says Sanders had his horse buggy equipped with the proper lights and wasn't violating any laws. She says Sanders told the officer he could not breathe after he began choking him, and he died there on the scene. She says then Sanders was taken to the hospital where his family was not allowed to see him. Sanders was a father to two children, and Kennedy says she's devastated their one-year-old child will have to grow up without a father.

While the MBI is investigating, Chief Street is asking the citizens to remain calm and communicate with police.

""We just ask that the citizens allow that to take place, not to try to take anything out in the streets. Our door is open,"" he says.

CLARKE COUNTY, Miss. (WJTV) — A Clarke County grand jury has decided not to indict an officer who was accused in the death of a 39-year-old man.

Stonewall Officer Kevin Herrington was accused of having a physical encounter with Jonathan Sanders on July 8, 2015. He died that same day.

The jury’s decision was detailed in a report released this morning by Clark County clerk’s office. The report says Sanders died from a combination of being strangled and a cocaine overdose.

Sanders was driving a horse and buggy in the town before he was stopped by police. Herrington stopped Sanders and confronted him, believing he was in possession of drugs, officials said. Officials said Sanders died after ingesting cocaine he was trying to hide.

“We’re deeply disappointed, but we’re not dismayed. We’re going to continue this fight,” Chokwe A. Lumumba, of Lumumba and Associates said. “We’re going to continue this fight and we will present some information going forward.”

The jury ruled that Officer Herrington did not use excessive force, instead he restrained Sanders in alignment with police protocol.

Attorneys for the Sanders’ family tell us there was a crowd of supporters outside the courthouse waiting for the decision to come down.

C.J. Lawrence, of Jackson-based Lumumba & Associates, tells WJTV he’s incredibly disappointed by the decision. “The grand jury documentation was sealed, so we won’t know what evidence was presented and how.”

Lawrence says he and his associate Chokwe A. Lumumba weren’t notified until Friday that the decision would be released today. They are promising to present facts and witnesses accounts that they claim were deliberately dismissed.

“We’re going to let people decide for themselves whether or not these witnesses are credible.

Arkansas officers have fatally shot a handcuffed parolee who authorities say shot at officers from inside of a patrol car.

Arkansas Department of Community Correction Deputy Director Dina Tyler said 35-year-old Jonathan McIntosh was killed Tuesday night at 905 E. Main St. in Cabot. She said McIntosh had been detained by Community Correction officers and the Lonoke County sheriff's office during a search for another suspect.

She said officers found suspected drugs while searching McIntosh and placed him in handcuffs in the back of the vehicle. She said McIntosh opened fire when officers went back to interview him.

Tyler said two Community Correction officers and one sheriff's office employee shot at McIntosh, who later died at an area hospital.

She said it's unclear where he got the gun.

CABOT, Ark. (KTHV) – Arkansas State Police are reporting that a man has died as the result of an officer-involved shooting.

According to Public Information Officer Bill Sadler, Lonoke County Sheriff's Office and Arkansas Department of Community Correction (ADCC) arrested 35-year-old man at the 900 block of East Main Street in Cabot Tuesday night.

Sadler said the man was placed into a law enforcement vehicle for hold when gunshots allegedly came from inside the car. He said law enforcement officers returned fire and struck the man, but reports did not say where he was hit.

Dina Tyler with ADCC said officers were actually searching for a different person on the night of the shooting and had gone to a residence where he might have been located. She said officers found two people there – one of them was 35-year-old Jonathan Macintosh.

Tyler said drugs were found on Macintosh, and he was subsequently cuffed and put in a patrol car. She went on to say that when they went back to question him, they opened the car door, and he began shooting at them with a small, compact handgun, forcing officers to return fire.

Tyler added that Macintosh was reportedly hit several times, and Sadler said he was taken to a hospital where he later died.

Tyler shared that Macintosh was on parole and was released in 2014 but had been doing well up until Tuesday night. He had apparently been in prison a few times – the first being on drug charges and the second being for felon in possession of a firearm.

According to Tyler, Macintosh was searched before he was put in the car, but ADCC is now investigating to see just how thoroughly he was searched or if someone could have dropped the gun to him from the car window.

No law enforcement personnel were injured. All ADCC officers involved are currently on leave while the investigation was underway. THV11 currently has no word on whether any officers from the sheriff's office are on leave.

A man is dead after a shooting at the Iuka Walmart on Sunday.

Howard Brent Means Jr., 34, of Tishomingo, was fatally shot in Walmart by an Iuka Police officer. Another officer, Joseph Marlar, was grazed by a bullet during the incident. He has been treated and released from the hospital.

According to Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Warren Strain, Means was shot and killed after he ran into the store and exchanged gunfire with officers.

His body has been sent to the state medical examiner’s office for an autopsy.

Details on the situation that led to the officer-involved shooting of Brent Means in the Iuka Walmart Sunday night are scarce.

Means, 34, was killed by police in an exchange of gunfire inside Walmart after he ran inside the store after a traffic pursuit, according to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.

MBI Spokesman Warren Strain said two officers from the Iuka Police Department started following Means' vehicle around 6:10 p.m. Sunday.

After a pursuit that lasted about five minutes, Means pulled into the Walmart parking lot and entered the store, Strain said.

Authorities said the man opened fire. He said the officers returned fire, and Means was killed. One officer was taken to a hospital for a minor injury and has since been released.

Both authorities and Means' friends said he had a shotgun. Strain said no bystanders were injured in the incident.

The preliminary investigation shows a conservation officer inside the store may have also been involved in the shooting, Strain said.

But Sheena Burton, a lifelong friend of Means said that his father Howard Means and Brent Means' friend Doug Matney were able to get to Walmart just after the shooting occurred.

She said Matney told her his wife ran into Means at a gas station, and that for some reason he didn't want to get out and pay for his gas and he drove off. She called her husband, who called Howard Means, and the two went to Walmart.

""But that's not in Brent's nature. I've run it in my head over and over trying to figure it out. That was not the real Brent, someone would have had to have triggered something,"" Burton said. ""Brent did not want anyone to fight, he wanted everyone to always get along, that was his main thing. He would always say you'll be here one day and gone tomorrow. He wanted everyone to always get along.""

Matney said he doesn't know what happened with Means, but that he hopes the Walmart security footage will explain more about what happened to his friend.

Burton said Means had looked out for her since her husband Chad, a close friend of his, was killed in a car accident 2008.

""I have to pray, I got on my knees last night and prayed,"" she said. ""There's a lot of grieving on me. I'm used to him texting or calling every day, or him being here every other day. He always said how much he loved me. It's really heartbreaking.""

Means, a father of three, had been sober for several months, Burton said. For the last two years on his Facebook page, he had documented his battle with sobriety, his time in rehabilitation, and his growing faith.

""He was the best person you could ever meet. You looked at his Facebook, there was always some kind of church verse or pictures with his kids,"" Burton said.

Means was a logger, and he drove race cars, as did his father. On his race car, he had the name and phone number of his recovery center prominently displayed. From his social media and by Burton's account, he was proud of his progress and his faith.

Burton said she saw him as late as Saturday night and nothing seemed to be wrong. She said she doesn't believe there would be any reason he would have been drinking, either.

""They can do a blood test, but even if he would have been drinking, I still don't think alcohol would have done that. I've seen Brent drunk back in the days when we all ran together, and he was a happy drunk,"" she said.

Strain said the state medical examiner will perform an autopsy on Tuesday, and the MBI is looking into the incident, which is routine for officer-involved shootings.

 Save for later
The police officer who killed Walter Scott in South Carolina laughed about the adrenaline rush he was feeling, in a conversation that offers a new insight into his mindset in the minutes after the shooting.

Patrolman Michael Slager made the remarks during a discussion with a senior officer after fatally shooting Scott in North Charleston on 5 April. A recording of their conversation was obtained by the Guardian.


 Audio of the call.
“By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,” the senior officer said. “You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.”

“It’s pumping,” Slager said, laughing. The senior officer replied: “Oh yeah. Oh yeah.”

The senior officer told Slager during the conversation to go home and relax, assuring him that he would not have to answer questions about the shooting for days.

Slager was charged with murder on Tuesday after authorities were given cellphone video showing the officer shot Scott eight times in the back as the 50-year-old ran away. The footage contradicted earlier claims by police that Scott had fled with Slager’s stun gun.

Asked whether the officer making the remarks in the recording was Slager, Thom Berry, a spokesman for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), which is investigating the shooting, said: “It appears that way. I have not been able to independently confirm it.”

A spokesman for North Charleston police did not respond to a request for comment.

Footage of Scott being stopped in his car minutes before the shooting by Slager over a broken brake light, which was recorded by the dashcam in Slager’s patrol car, was released to the media on Thursday.

That camera continued to record for another hour and captured the conversation between Slager and a senior officer. A cellphone call that Slager, 33, received about five minutes before his conversation with the senior officer was also partly recorded.

“Hey. Hey, everything’s OK, OK?” Slager said, after an iPhone ringtone was heard. Following an inaudible section, Slager then appeared to say: “He grabbed my taser, yeah. Yeah, he was running from me.”

Slager’s wife, Jamie, is eight months pregnant with their first child. Jamie Slager, 35, has two children from a previous marriage. The couple live together in the city of Hanahan, about six miles from North Charleston.

In the recording from the dashcam in Slager’s radio car, the officer can be heard asking: “What happens next?” The senior officer, whose identity is not clear from the recording, told him that he would be collected by other officers and taken to police headquarters.

“Probably once they get you there, we’ll take you home. Take your crap off, take your vest off, kind of relax for two or three.”

“It’ll be real quick,” he said. “They’re gonna tell you you’re gonna be out for a couple of days and you’ll come back and they’ll interview you then. They’re not going to ask you any kind of questions right now. They’ll take your weapon and we’ll go from there. That’s pretty much it.”

The senior officer again reassured Slager that he would not have to explain the shooting on the record immediately. “The last one we had, they waited a couple of days to interview officially, like, sit down and tell what happened,” he said.",Yes,Yes,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb805185a709f1ecffd49a46abe3c05a2f8084d5/0_82_1500_900/1500.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=635fd95e133e7e0394f4e3b94c9c9f29,Yes,"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb805185a709f1ecffd49a46abe3c05a2f8084d5/0_82_1500_900/1500.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=635fd95e133e7e0394f4e3b94c9c9f29 ,

The police officer who shot Walter Scott radioed in to claim that Scott had “grabbed my Taser”, six seconds after firing his final shot, despite video suggesting the unarmed man was not in possession of the stun gun at any point, a Guardian analysis has shown.

Syncing police scanner audio with a shocking video – the eyewitness footage out of South Carolina which led to officer Michael Slager being charged with murder – raises further questions about whether either of two officers on the video performed any CPR on Scott as was previously claimed by police.

Analysis of the police radio shows Slager, the officer who shot at Scott eight times, making the radio call announcing the shots and alleging the Taser seizure, sounding frantic and breathless at the same time as he walks slowly towards Scott’s body.

“Shots fired. Subject is down. He grabbed my Taser,” the scanner audio from Slager states.


 Officer Michael Slager dispatch audio from the Walter Scott shooting.
He reaches the body, handcuffs Scott who has his head down to the floor and walks back to the area where it appears an object was dropped and picks up an item from the ground.

At this point a second officer, now identified as Clarence Habersham, arrives on the scene and radios in. Slager then walks back towards the body and radios in stating: “I need to secure my vehicle”. At this point – over a minute after the last shot is fired – neither officer appears to have performed CPR on Scott.

Slager then walks and drops the item, which some have speculated is a Taser, next to Scott’s body.

At this point Habersham radios in to say he has detected gunshots to Scott’s chest on the right side. He then radios to say he has detected a gunshot wound to the buttocks. He appears to be pulling Scott’s T-shirt up at this point.

At a press conference on Wednesday North Charleston police chief Eddie Driggers said after watching the video he believed an officer had lifted Scott’s T-shirt to perform “some sort of life-saving procedure”.

But analysis of the video and audio suggests Habersham is actually identifying the gunshot wounds rather than performing any such procedure.

At the end of the video, over two minutes after the last shot is fired, Slager stands over Scott’s body and takes a pulse.

The combination of the video and audio footage shows that the encounter between Slager and Scott started about four and a half minutes before the scenes now seen on televisions around the world.

As Slager began stopping Scott at the intersection of Remount Road and Craig Road at about 9.35am, he radioed the dispatcher to say he was “coming up on a grey ... Mercedes”.

Exactly three minutes later, Slager radioed again to announce he was chasing on foot down Craig, giving his dispatcher a basic description of Scott. “Black male, green shirt, blue pants,” he said.

About 25 seconds later a colleague radioed to say he was “en route” to assist. Ten seconds on, there was another message – possibly from the same officer – asking Slager (“223”) “What’s your direction of travel there?”

After he received no response, this officer asked Slager again: “Where you at now?” Eight seconds later, however, there was a clue to why Slager may not have been responding. In a burst of confused radio chatter, an officer can be heard shouting “on the ground!”

The dispatcher had asked all officers to ensure radio silence for matters apart from the Slager-Scott chase. Feidin Santana, a bystander who filmed the shooting on his cellphone, told NBC on Wednesday evening that the pair were struggling on the ground before he began recording.

Another 47 seconds pass before the supporting officer radioed again: “I’m at the pawn shop,” he said. “Where you at now?”

Just three seconds later – at 9.38am, almost five minutes after Slager announced that he was stopping Scott in his car – Slager was back on the radio. “223, shots fired,” he said. “Subject is down. He grabbed my Taser.”",Yes,Yes,https://embed.theguardian.com/embed/video/us-news/video/2015/apr/09/north-charleston-shooting-police-scanner-video,Yes,"https://embed.theguardian.com/embed/video/us-news/video/2015/apr/09/north-charleston-shooting-police-scanner-video  ,

A white police officer in South Carolina has been charged with the murder of a 50-year-old black man shot eight times in the back as he ran away.

Footage of the shooting, which occurred at about 9.30am on Saturday after Walter Scott was pulled over for a traffic violation, shows North Charleston officer Michael Slager firing eight times at Scott. Slager initially told police he shot Scott because he feared for his life while the two fought over Slager’s stun gun.

After Scott is shot, the video also appears to show the police officer picking an object off the ground and dropping it next to Scott’s body. Scott does not appear in possession of the stun gun at any point in the video.

The footage was posted online by Charleston’s Post & Courier on Tuesday, and filmed by an anonymous bystander. It appears to show that a stun gun wire has already been deployed, but falls out as Scott runs away from Slager, who pulls out his firearm and shoots until Scott falls to the ground. The officer then walks over to the body and appears to talk into his radio. He reaches the body and shouts: “Put your hands behind your back now, put your hands behind your back”. Scott is motionless, his face down in the ground.

The officer then appears to shout “Put your hands behind your back” again before picking up Scott’s limp arms and placing them in what look like handcuffs.

Slager then moves away from the body and picks up an item from the ground, near where he fired the shots. At this point another officer arrives on the scene and stands over Scott’s body.

Slager walks back over to the body and appears to drop the item he has picked up next to Scott’s body.

According to an incident file, reported by local TV news, Slager said over the radio that he deployed his Taser and “seconds later” he said: “Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.”

Neither officer appears to be aware they are being filmed, and the cameraperson seems to place his finger over the lens a number of times. It does not appear that Slager checks Scott’s pulse until three minutes and three seconds into the film.

Slager had initially released a statement through his lawyer, claiming he had “followed all the proper procedures and policies of the North Charleston police department”.

But at a press conference on Tuesday, North Charleston mayor Keith Summey told reporters that Slager had made a “bad decision”.

“When you’re wrong, you’re wrong,” Summey said as quoted by the Post and Courier. “When you make a bad decision, don’t care if you’re behind the shield or a citizen on the street, you have to live with that decision.”

 Walter Scott’s family ‘relieved’ police officer has been charged with murder
The North Charleston police chief, Eddie Driggers, said officer Slager, 33, had been arrested and charged with murder.

Attorney L Chris Stewart, who came to North Charleston a day after the shooting to represent the family, said the video forced authorities to act quickly and decisively, and he called the person who made the video a hero.

“What happened today doesn’t happen all the time,” Stewart told a news conference. “What if there was no video?” Scott’s mother stood nearby, saying, “Thank you, Lord” and “Hallelujah.”

The family plans to file a civil rights suit against Slager, the department and the city, Stewart said.

Scott’s older brother Anthony told the Post & Courier: “We just would like for justice to be taken, for justice to be served, and we would like for the truth to come out so my brother can rest in peace. Whatever happened yesterday, all we want is the truth, and we will go to any length to get it.”

Anthony Scott said his late sibling served for two years in the US Coast Guard, that he was a father of four, and that he loved the Dallas Cowboys.

According to the Post & Courier, Walter Scott had a warrant out for his arrest from a family court at the time of his death. 

His arrest history, mostly for contempt of court charges for failing to pay child support, included one accusation of a violation stemming from an assault and battery charge in 1987, the newspaper reported.

A local Black Lives Matter group, formed after the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last August, has planned a demonstration on Wednesday morning at North Charleston city hall.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division have also launched investigations into Saturday’s shooting.

“The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the South Carolina US Attorney’s Office will work with the FBI in the investigation. The Department of Justice will take appropriate action in light of the evidence and developments in the state case,” the Justice Department said in a statement.

The murder charges against Slager come amid a national debate on police practice after a spate of high-profile police killings around the country.

President Barack Obama convened a national police taskforce in the wake of the death of Brown in Ferguson, which sparked a wave of unrest in the small city and protests across the country.

The taskforce recommended a variety of criminal justice reforms last month, including that local law enforcement agencies report each officer involved in a shooting to federal government when they occur. At present there are no official national statistics on officers involved in fatalities as local agencies are not required to provide information to the federal government.

Also in South Carolina, a white police officer was charged on Tuesday in the case of a 68-year-old black man who was shot dead last year. A grand jury had earlier chosen to indict North Augusta officer Justin Craven on a charge of misconduct in office, rather than the manslaughter indictment sought by prosecutors, in the February 2014 death of Ernest Satterwhite. The new charge, discharging a gun into an occupied vehicle, is a felony.

A city in South Carolina approved a $6.5m million settlement Thursday with the family of an unarmed black man shot dead earlier this year by a white police officer.

North Charleston city council approved the settlement by a 10-0 vote, and members of Walter Scott’s family were on hand when it was announced.

The council had met several times in the past few months to receive advice from city attorney Brady Hair on a potential lawsuit from Scott’s family.

Scott, 50, was shot on 4 April by North Charleston officer Michael Slager while trying to run from a traffic stop. A bystander recorded the shooting with a cellphone and the shooting inflamed the national debate about how black people are treated by law enforcement officers.

Slager was indicted on a murder charge in June and a judge refused to set bond last month, saying his release would “constitute an unreasonable danger to the community”.

Slager was fired following his arrest on the murder charges and has been detained in solitary confinement.

The bystander’s cellphone video showed Slager firing eight times as Scott ran.

 ‘I will never get over it’: Feidin Santana on filming the police shooting of Walter Scott. Link to video.
Before the video was brought to the attention of authorities, Slager had told investigators that Scott tried to grab his gun and Taser. But prosecutor Scarlett Wilson said Scott was running away and the only time Slager could be seen running was to go back, pick up the Taser and then drop it by Scott’s body.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Scott’s family called for peace. Some have credited the family’s action – along with the officer’s speedy arrest – with staving off the protests and violence that have erupted in other cities where unarmed black men have died during encounters with police.

Slager faces from 30 years to life in prison without parole if he is convicted of murder.

In the most violent day in the young history of UC Merced, a male student armed with a large hunting knife attacked four people on campus Wednesday before he was shot down by police, a spree of bloodshed that shocked the tight-knit campus and left investigators searching for a motive.

The school day was just beginning when authorities said the student, whose name was not released, had a confrontation with others in a second-floor classroom on the north side of the campus and apparently stabbed another student. A construction worker, 31-year-old Byron Price, who was nearby heard the commotion and went in to intervene, authorities said.

The attacker lunged at Price and slashed him before fleeing. He stabbed a male student outside the classroom and then left the building, where he found a female university employee sitting on a bench and stabbed her in the back. Two university police officers chased the man onto a bridge, where he was shot and killed.

Authorities said the suspect was a California resident in his late teens or early 20s who was not from Merced County. His name was being withheld while officials tried to contact his family.

All four stabbing victims were expected to recover.

Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke described Price as “the true hero in all of this chaos.”

“Without him, the first victim could have been a lot worse off, or even dead,” he said.

The attack, the most serious violence to strike the 10-year-old UC campus, stunned students and officials.

“Events like this happen elsewhere but not at UC Merced, which may still be small in its student body but large in its sense of community,” Chancellor Dorothy Leland said at a press conference.

Classes were canceled for Wednesday and Thursday and by late afternoon, the campus, normally bustling with nearly 6,700 students, was largely vacant.

Investigators evacuated the Tuolumne residence hall, a two-story dormitory in the center of the campus. Officials said only they were doing so to “widen the crime scene” and would not say whether the suspect lived there.

Authorities have not commented on any possible motive in the attack.

Law enforcement officials said the student used a large hunting knife with a blade 8 inches to 10 inches long in the attack.

Price was one of three Artisan Construction workers remodeling the student waiting room at the Classroom and Office Building on Wednesday morning, according to Artisan CEO John Price, who is also Price’s father.

“They heard a scuffle in the classroom right across from where they were working and it sounded like a fight. So (my son) opened the door and the guy lunged at him,” John Price told the Merced Sun-Star. “It got the (attacker) outside the room, away from others.”

The younger Price was stabbed at least once and taken to Mercy Medical Center by his coworkers. John Price said his son was released from the hospital before noon Wednesday and had no injuries to major arteries.

UC officials said one of the campus officers was placed on an automatic three-day leave pending an investigation, a standard proceedure for officer-involved shootings.

Warnke said the Sheriff’s Department was assisting in the investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has “offered assistance” with the case, FBI spokeswoman Gina Swankie confirmed.

A Merced-area law enforcement bomb squad arrived on campus around noon to search the area. Authorities said the specialty squad was dispatched as a precaution to investigate an item near the suspect’s body, but there was no specific threat.

The campus community first was notified of the attack shortly after 8 a.m. when school officials issued an alert on Twitter, advising students to avoid the area around the Classroom and Office Building.

Students arriving for morning classes found a campus on lockdown and activities canceled.

Charyea Phillips, a 22-year-old senior, was among the students walking off campus and onto the rural roads leading toward Merced. A psychology major from Los Angeles, Phillips said her campus job is located near the scene of the stabbing and she saw officers responding to the site.

“Just to see something like that happen, it could have been me,” she said. The attack is something she would have expected to see in Los Angeles, not at a small town campus like UC Merced. “That’s why I moved away from there.”

Blanca Ayala, a senior psychology major from the Mexican state of Sinaloa, said she was studying on campus when she heard about the attack. “It never crosses your mind that your life is in danger.”

A male UC Merced student stabbed four people with a large hunting knife on the campus Wednesday morning before he was shot and killed by university police, authorities said.

The victims' injuries do not appear to be life-threatening, officials said.

The suspect’s identity is known to authorities but had not been publicly released because they were still trying to notify his family, said Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke.

He spoke at an afternoon news conference where university and law enforcement officials described a chaotic chain of events that began in the Classroom and Office Building near the center of campus.

The attack began just before 8 a.m. in a second-story classroom, when the suspect stabbed a student, Warnke said.

 4 Stabbed on UC Merced Campus; Alleged Attacker Fatally Shot
A male student at UC Merced stabbed four people on campus as classes began Wednesday morning and was later fatally shot by campus police, a school spokesman said.
Byron Price -- a 31-year-old employee with Artisan Construction who was working with two colleagues on a renovation project in the building -- heard chairs crashing and screams from the classroom down the hall, his father, John Price, said in an interview.

Byron Price thought there was a fight and went in to stop it, his father said.

Warnke, who did not use Price’s name, said the construction worker “stumbled onto” the stabbing and that his entrance probably saved students’ lives. Warnke did not go into detail, citing the ongoing investigation, but called his actions ""heroic.""

After stabbing the student and Price in the classroom, the suspect fled down a flight of stairs, trying to injure others as he ran, Warnke said. The assailant injured another student outside the building and then approached a female university staff member seated outside, stabbing her multiple times.

The staff member was “sitting, literally minding her own business,” Warnke said.

Two campus police officers chased the suspect and shot him on a pedestrian bridge on campus, said UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland.

The eight- to 10-inch, fixed-blade hunting knife was found within four feet of the suspect’s body, and he was carrying a backpack, according to the sheriff. Authorities said they would search his room and that the FBI was involved in the investigation.

The assailant was described as a California resident from outside Merced County who lived on campus. Warnke said the Sheriff’s Department had no prior contact with him.  

Two of the victims were airlifted to hospitals and all were conscious, according to the school.

“Their injuries, thank God, appear not to be life-threatening,” said Leland, who called Wednesday “a sad and tragic day.”

Student witnesses have been undergoing “very comprehensive interviews” by authorities, and some had tried to administer first aid to the wounded, she said.

“Both our police and students acted in a way that would make all of us very proud,” Leland said. “This was a tragic event, but the person who caused this event will no longer be able to cause an event like this in the future. The children are safe here.”

The campus was closed after the attack and is expected to reopen Friday. School officials have offered counseling to those who want it and shuttles to people who need transportation.

“I can tell you that we’re really shocked and saddened by this,” said Lorena Anderson, a school spokeswoman. “We’re doing everything we can to contact family and parents to make sure everyone here is safe and secure.”

Anderson said the crime scene included the building, “the whole center of campus,” and the pedestrian bridge across a canal that divides the campus in two.

Officials said they were trying to determine a motive. 

Angela J. Yi, an 18-year-old freshman, was attending her morning writing class on the second floor of the Classroom and Office Building early Wednesday when she heard yelling from a classroom down the hall. It was a man’s voice. Then came loud footsteps.

“It sounded like someone was running,” Yi said. “My professor went out to see what went on, and when she came back inside she was in a serious mood and told us not to leave the classroom.”

She and her classmates were calm, she said, because they didn’t know what had happened. Police arrived and taped off the classroom where the stabbings occurred, and she left, grateful that none of her classmates were injured.

On Wednesday afternoon, Shayan Rostami, a 19-year-old freshman, read a text message from a classmate aloud as he walked with a group of friends to Lake Yosemite, near campus.

“Dude, I’m shaking,” the message read, according to Rostami. “In a million years I never thought it would happen on our campus.”

Lois Vincent, an 18-year-old freshman, looked around at the rustling oaks and the Sierra mountains in the distance.

“There’s birds chirping, the wind is blowing and you want to think, ‘life goes on,’” he said. “But it happened. And it hurts. And, I don’t want to be that guy, but it’s going to feel different. How do you protect yourself?”

UC Merced stabbings
Daniel Garcia-Ceja, a UC Merced junior, said he was walking to class Wednesday morning and ran into a police barricade at the Scholars Lane Bridge.

Garcia-Ceja, 21, said friends who were in the area at the time told him that a person with a knife was shot and killed on the bridge. They said they saw the assailant approaching students with a knife.

""Some of my friends wanted to cry. Some were upset. Some were in shock. It was insane to hear that this happened in general,” Garcia-Ceja said. “You know it's happened at other universities, and you know schools have been through these situations ... but I don't think anybody would have assumed it would happen here. We knew it could happen, but nobody thought it would.""

Garcia-Ceja had a morning class at the Classroom and Office Building. He described it as a large lecture hall with a mixture of classrooms.

He usually comes to class an hour early to study for quizzes but slept in on Wednesday. He would have been at the building at the time of the attack had he followed his normal routine, he said.

Garcia-Ceja said the campus was largely on lockdown and that students were gathered in small groups talking about the stabbing, trying to figure out what had happened. Like many others, he turned to social media to try to get updates, he said, but there was a lot of confusion.

His brother, Martin Garcia-Ceja, who graduated from the college in 2014, said there was a stabbing on campus a few years ago that was believed to be gang-related. He said he was at a friend's dorm when another student ran past, bleeding. The campus was shut down and the suspect was apprehended, but there wasn't a lot of talk about it afterward.

Martin Garcia-Ceja, 23, of Ontario, said the campus was very open and easy for both students and nonstudents to access.

""We were told our campus was safe, that security was everywhere, but no one really knew,"" he said. ""We were under the impression that we were always safe, but when that [prior stabbing] occurred, we understood that maybe we should take more serious precautions.""

About 6,700 students attend UC Merced. The school opened in September 2005 as the 10th campus in the University of California system, with a dedicated mission to increase college attendance in the San Joaquin Valley. The school is one of the biggest employers in Merced County, with more than 1,300 employees.

Anderson, the school spokeswoman, said the campus “is like a little family.”

""We’re small,” she said. ""A lot of us know each other really well. It’s shocking. You hear about it at other places and you hope to God it’s not going to happen on our campus.”

 Four Wounded, Attacker Dead After Stabbing on UC Merced Campus 0:19
The knife-wielding student who was fatally shot by police following a stabbing rampage at the University of California's Merced campus was identified Thursday as 18-year-old Faisal Mohammad.

Mohammad was a freshman computer science and engineering major from Santa Clara, a Northern California community in the Bay Area, the Merced County Sheriff's Office said. A motive for the attack, which wounded four people, was not immediately released.

Shortly before 8 a.m. Wednesday, police said, Mohammad burst through a second-floor room in the Classroom and Office Building and stabbed one student with an 8- to 10-inch blade. A construction worker who overheard the noise rushed inside and tried to distract the suspect, but was also stabbed.

As he fled down a flight of stairs, police said, Mohammad stabbed a second student and a student adviser before officers responding to the scene caught up with him.

""When the suspect turned toward the officers, an officer-involved shooting occurred and the suspect succumbed to his injuries,"" UC Merced Police Chief Albert Vasquez said Wednesday.

All four victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries. As of Thursday morning, one student remained hospitalized but was expected to recover, Merced County authorities said. The student adviser suffered a collapsed lung, but was recovering after surgery.

The other student and the construction worker were treated Wednesday and released.

Price told NBC affiliate KRCA that the suspect swung his knife down at him, and he didn't initially feel pain. What he'll remember most, he said, was the look the assailant gave.

""He had a smile on his face, he was having fun, which is more the thing that bothers me,"" Price said.

His father, John Price, told the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday that his son has the right demeanor when confronted with difficult situations.

""Byron's really good at calming people down,"" John Price said. ""And then if you still want to fight, well, OK, he can do that, too.""

Mohammad graduated from Santa Clara's Wilcox High School in June, officials confirmed to NBC News.

""This news comes as a shock to our entire community,"" the school said in a statement. ""Counselors are available to our students and staff to help them process this information in a supportive way.""

A student who went to high school with Mohammad told NBC News that he was ""quiet, smart and did not bother anyone. He showed no signs of mental illness or aggression.""

Leslie Sapp III confronted law enforcement officers with a air pistol that looked like a real gun when the team entered his home in Pittsburgh's Knoxville area to arrest the 47-year-old man before dawn on Jan. 6, District Attorney Stephen Zappala said Wednesday.

""Why would Mr. Sapp put himself in that position? He's a 47-year-old man, he's looking at 30-60 years as a sex offender. It's speculative. I don't have anything to say he intended to commit suicide by a police officer. It's a reasonable conclusion to draw,"" Zappala said. ""As to use of deadly force, I believe that the team was of the reasonable belief that they were the object of (intended) death or serious bodily injury, and their response was both appropriate and necessary under the circumstances.""

Richard Dwyer, an Allegheny County sheriff's deputy who fired one of the shots that hit Sapp, tested positive for cocaine metabolites after the shooting -- meaning he likely used the drug two or three days before, Zappala said. ""He was not under the influence of cocaine on Jan. 6, 2015.

Prior to giving the sample, his actions were otherwise not reckless,"" Zappala said.

Dwyer has been fired because of the drug test, which is required of all law enforcement who are involved in a fatal shooting, but his lawyer hopes Dwyer will get his job back under a ""last chance"" program.",Yes,No,,No,,"NA ,

Aaron Gibe: The Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper will not face criminal charges related to the April shooting death of Gary Timmie Collins.
Posted: Wednesday, April 29, 2015 12:00 am
By SAMANTHA VICENT World Staff Writer | 1 comment
MIAMI, Oklahoma — The Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper who fatally shot a Miami man on Friday has been a part of the agency for less than a year, an OHP spokesman said Tuesday.
Aaron Gibe became an OHP member in June 2014, Lt. John Vincent said.
Gibe shot 63-year-old Gary Timmie Collins when an altercation ensued at a driver's license checkpoint in a Miami neighborhood, Vincent said.
While stopped at the checkpoint, an OHP trooper waved Collins over to him, but Collins fled and led troopers on a six-block chase, Vincent said on Saturday. Gibe shot Collins after the man stepped out of his vehicle while showing a weapon ""in a threatening manner,"" the spokesman said.
It wasn't clear Tuesday whether Gibe was the trooper who gestured to Collins. The Miami News Record newspaper reported Collins exited a PT Cruiser near H Street Northwest and 20th Street, where he died after being shot.
Gibe has since been placed on administrative leave, and the incident remains under investigation.",Yes,No,,Yes,NA,NA,Yes,http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/crimewatch/ottawa-county-da-rules-ohp-trooper-justified-in-miami-shooting/article_2703fe57-e5c8-5338-a2d1-b90fc3fa9afe.html,Ottawa County DA rules OHP trooper justified in Miami shooting death; medical examiner's office releases cause of death report,"Ottawa County DA rules OHP trooper justified in Miami shooting death; medical examiner's office releases cause of death report

Aaron Gibe: The Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper will not face criminal charges related to the April shooting death of Gary Timmie Collins.
Posted: Friday, June 5, 2015 12:00 am | Updated: 1:30 pm, Mon Apr 11, 2016.
By SAMANTHA VICENT World Staff Writer | 35 comments
MIAMI, Okla. — A 63-year-old man who was killed by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper after he led the trooper on a chase in Miami in April was struck by gunfire at least seven times, according to a medical examiner’s report.
The state Medical Examiner’s Office stated in its report, released Thursday, that Gary Timmie Collins died April 24 of three gunshot wounds to the middle and left upper back and also had wounds on the right side of his chest, his right arm, and his left arm and hand.
Earlier in the week, the Ottawa County District Attorney’s Office ruled that OHP Trooper Aaron Gibe, who fatally shot Collins, would not face criminal charges.
Gibe, who joined the agency 10 months earlier, in June 2014, shot at Collins after the man stepped out of his Chrysler PT Cruiser while showing a firearm “in a threatening manner,” Lt. John Vincent said at the time.
Gibe, Vincent said, thought his life was in danger and shot Collins, who died at the scene. The medical examiner’s report says Collins had a 0.08 blood alcohol concentration at the time of his death.
Vincent said Collins had run from a driver’s license checkpoint on U.S. 69 in Miami after being waved over by a trooper, leading authorities on a six-block chase that ended near 20th Street and H Street Northwest.
The Tulsa World filed an open records request for dash-cam video footage of the chase and shooting, which the OHP provided on Thursday. The video is about an hour long, and the altercation between Gibe and Collins begins just after the 32-minute mark.
In the video, Gibe yells, “Stop! Stop!” to Collins, who had begun to get out of his car, and one shot can be heard between the two words. Gibe then shoots five times at Collins, causing a weapon to drop from Collins’ hand.
After the weapon falls, at least five more shots are fired before Collins is seen falling to the ground. Gibe was not injured.
Ottawa County District Attorney Kenny Wright, who also works in Delaware County, said it appeared that Gibe followed proper policies and procedures in his handling of the situation.
“There’s really no other option for a law enforcement officer in that situation when he presents himself with a firearm and the trooper tells him twice to stop,” Wright said. “An officer can’t wait and see what’s going to happen next.”
Wright said it remained unclear, even after watching dash-cam video footage of the shooting, whether Collins fired his weapon at the trooper. He also said Gibe’s service weapon, believed to have a 14-round capacity, had at least half of its bullets remaining after Collins was shot.
Wright’s office ruled on the criminal aspects of the case before receiving the medical examiner’s report, saying it “just depends on the case” when deciding whether to wait to know the official cause of death. The OHP’s “extensive investigation” on the shooting, Wright said, meant the cause of death report wasn’t needed to make the ruling.
He still had not received a copy of the medical examiner’s report as of 3 p.m. Thursday, he said.
OHP Capt. Paul Timmons said Thursday afternoon that he had not received any updates on the department’s internal investigation of the incident and that Gibe remains on administrative leave.

The family of Kristiana Coignard is considering legal action against police in east Texas after Coignard, a mentally ill 17-year-old, was shot dead when she entered a police station in what relatives described as a cry for help.

Coignard was killed on the night of 22 January about 10 minutes after she arrived in the lobby of the police department in Longview, two hours’ drive east of Dallas, and used a phone to summon an officer. Her death sparked demonstrations and cyber-attacks on the city’s website linked to the Anonymous “hacktivist” group.

Coignard’s San Antonio-based parents have hired an attorney and held a press conference on Monday, saying they want to see some form of “justice” done in the wake of her death. They told the Guardian they will wait until the Texas Rangers have concluded their investigation before deciding whether to launch a suit.

Their lawyer, Tim Maloney, said he was helping the family make freedom of information requests last week to try and gather more details before the possible filing of a wrongful death or other civil rights violation claim.


Kristiana Coignard: video shows Texas police station shooting

Footage of the incident has been viewed more than 800,000 times on YouTube and raises questions about whether her death could have been avoided if officers had handled the situation differently. Her family, who have viewed the video, believe that police failed to defuse the situation using the kind of crisis management techniques that are now taught as standard in many police departments across the country, including in San Antonio, which has made the proper handling of encounters that have the potential to turn violent a priority in recent years.

During a struggle that lasted several minutes, one officer appears to have subdued Coignard but then releases her. Two other officers arrive, weapons are drawn and she is shot five times by two officers after rushing at one of them with what police said was a butcher knife. An officer who had been on the scene for less than 10 seconds fired twice.

Police said that Coignard had “I have a gun” written on her hand and that an attempt to Taser her had no effect. In the video, the officers seem to make little or no effort to give Coignard first aid until paramedics arrive about seven minutes later.

“Our belief is that she went there asking for help. It’s evident just by watching the video of how long she was calm, cooperative, subdued. For so many, I’m guessing about 10, minutes, there wasn’t any violence on her part, or charging, or anything like that. So I know that it was asking for help, that was her intent,” said her father, Erik Coignard.

“In the video it’s evident there are lots of times when she was under the officer’s control and she could have and should have been restrained at that point. It would have been a very different outcome.”

The teenager worked at a KFC in San Antonio but had recently moved to Longview “to stay with her grandparents as part of her getting on her feet just before she turned 18”, he said.

Maloney said that she had never been arrested before and did not have a violent history, but occasionally had episodes of “acting out” where she became agitated. The family declined to detail her precise medical condition. She had reportedly been hospitalised in the past.

“She was on regular medication and also on counselling, therapy, and seeing a counsellor that day as part of her regular treatment,” Coignard said. Her stepmother, Elizabeth Canales-Coignard, said there had been no indication earlier in the day that Kristiana was in crisis.

“She was texting me back and forth and it was very positive, it was very loving. In our conversation with her through texts that day, she was having a good day. It’s not to our knowledge otherwise,” she said.

Monday’s press conference was held in San Antonio, which has become a national model for its treatment of mentally ill people in crisis. More than a decade ago, with an influx of mentally ill people contributing to acute overcrowding in the county jail, all the relevant players – police, courts, health and homelessness services – in the city and surrounding county combined to radically overhaul the system.

Now a police officer dealing with a mentally ill person in crisis in the nation’s seventh-largest city is more likely to pull out a set of flash cards than a gun or a Taser. The jail had between 600-1,000 empty beds at times last year and the city is saving an estimated $10m per year.

The vast majority of San Antonio’s officers have undergone Crisis Intervention Team training, a 40-hour programme that teaches them how to react when they encounter someone in the middle of a mental health crisis.

“[At the start] I heard things like ‘I’m a cop, not a social worker,’” said Leon Evans, director of the community mental health system in the San Antonio region.

“This is not ‘hug-a-thug’, which I heard from law enforcement officers; this is really about protecting them and society and not criminalising people with mental illness and making sure they get to the right place,” he said.

Raul Garza is a sergeant with the San Antonio sheriff’s department outreach team. “Everybody’s given what we call ‘cop cards’. They’re laminated cards on a little ring and you carry those with you in your patrol bag. It’s a wealth of information and resources that you can pass along to the family and that helps to calm the situation down and let them know we’re here to help, that not everyone we come in contact with goes to jail,” he said.

The cards – 24 pages of them – contain information on dozens of medicines and guidelines such as “Do not argue or question their delusions,” “Do not use analogies” and “Do not threaten arrest falsely.”

Garza said that in the two-and-a-half years since he joined the 16-person unit, they have only used a Taser once, last summer. In 2014, he said, the unit came into contact with 7,500 mentally ill people. Garza believes CIT training should be mandatory. The level of take-up varies greatly from state to state and department to department.

“First and foremost is always talk, you want to talk to the person. And then second is actively listen to find out what’s going on,” Garza said. ”You now know how to direct their anger, direct their frustrations to where it needs to be directed so you can work together with this person to find a solution.”

San Antonio also has a six-person roving mental health unit that is called out to emergencies. Officers wear plain clothes so as not to appear threatening.

“Generally speaking [police] are trained to use their command voice. That works well on you and I and bad guys, but if you get in one of these situations where it’s not logical and people aren’t thinking right, and you get in their face and start screaming, bad things happen. Officers get hurt, the public get hurt,” Evans said.

Reliable figures on the number of people shot by police in the US each year are difficult to come by, but a 2013 Treatment Advocacy Center report found that it is likely that “at least half of the people shot and killed by police each year in this country have mental health problems”.

Evans said that in Texas the seriously mentally ill die on average 29 years earlier than the general population. A 2010 survey of the 50 states and District of Columbia found that Texas ranks second from the bottom in per capita mental health spending, with an outlay about 10 times lower than DC’s.

But in recent years, high-profile conservatives such as Newt Gingrich and Jeb Bush have advocated progressive criminal justice reforms and backed the Texas-founded Right on Crime project, which argues that reducing the prison population in an intelligent way could save money without impacting public safety.

“You’ve got very conservative people, who used to want to cuff and stuff everybody, who believe in treatment now and understand it’s good for taxpayers, it improves the public safety net, you’re not criminalising somebody for having an illness,” said Evans.

As well as training officers to reduce the risk of violent confrontations, San Antonio also looked again at what happens next when urgent action is required. A decade or so ago, the two most likely options were to take the person to jail or to the emergency room. The first option was simply a stopgap with no long-term benefits, while the second might tie up an officer for up to 14 hours as he or she waited for the person to be evaluated, resulting in wasted time and expensive overtime costs.

Now, the police can take people to the Restoration Center, a nondescript building in a desolate-looking part of town just a mile-and-a-half from Texas’s most famous tourist attraction, the Alamo.

Adjacent to a homeless shelter, it has a waiting room for walk-ins accessed via an airport-style metal detector and special doors so police officers can drop off people straight into the sobering unit – a large, odorous room filled with mattresses – or other sections of the building that are devoted to medical services, detox and mental health crisis.

On one evening last week there were three people in the 16-bed crisis unit, which temporarily houses those suffering acute crises. Two emergency detainees and one person who had voluntarily agreed to be admitted were under 24-hour observation by a team of care workers sat behind glass at a bank of computers and office equipment.

The set-up allows the efficient treatment of people who may have multiple problems, said Christi Garfield, the vice-president of restoration services, as well as saving law enforcement time, money and paperwork and reducing the chance of a repeat encounter. Each month about 400 people are screened for entry into the crisis unit, and 200 admitted. About 25,000 people come to the center each year, many of them brought by police. “Before it was here they’d just take you to jail,” Garfield said.

Maloney, the lawyer, said that the family hopes Coignard’s death will prompt a national debate about how the police handle encounters with mentally ill people. “CIT should be mandatory for all police across the state of Texas, it shouldn’t be a department by department decision,” he said. Two of the three officers involved had some CIT training, according to WFAB local news.

“The situation sadly is not going to be isolated to this incident, there’s going to be other issues and if one thing good comes of this, it’s that we create a national dialogue – we’ve got this crisis, how are we going to deal with it?” Maloney said. “It’s not a situation without an answer. It’s just simply whether or not we’re going to spend time and resources to adequately train patrol officers to de-escalate instead of confront.”

With better training, Erik Coignard said, he and his wife are convinced that “Kristiana would still be alive today.”

Three cops, a 17-year-old and 'a cry for help': why did Kristiana Coignard die?
A mysterious encounter at a Texas police department has mental health advocates wondering a question resounding from Ferguson to Washington and beyond: can’t the US keep better track of police killings?

Just after sunset last Thursday, 17-year-old Kristiana Coignard entered a police station in Longview, Texas, a small city two hours east of Dallas with a history of police violence not all that different from the rest of the United States – but no less mysterious.

Coignard picked up a red, wall-mounted phone in the police department lobby and asked to speak with an officer – for reasons that also remain unclear.

The teenager may have been “wielding a knife”, according to the mayor. Police say “they were confronted by a white female who threatened them” – after which she brandished some sort of weapon, “made threatening movements toward the officers and was shot”. Motives on either side are still relatively unknown.

What is clear, nearly a week later in Texas and six months after police killings and community relations starting coming under renewed scrutiny across the US, is that another teenager has died after being shot “multiple times” by local cops. Three officers are on paid leave, the Longview police told the Guardian. A preliminary autopsy report has ruled the death a homicide.

And in the case of Kristiana Coignard, as in what advocates and sheriffs agree constitute more than half of US police killings each year, the victim appears to have had mental health problems.

Call it “justifiable homicide”: FBI statistics counted 461 encounters between police and those they killed with the threat of violence in 2013. Some have dubbed it “suicide-by-cop”, as about one-third of such cases can be classified – in addition, undoubtedly, to many more undercounted deaths. The hacktivist collective Anonymous prefers the phrase “trained to kill”.

Whatever you call the overlapping patterns of police violence and brief encounters with young and possibly unstable citizens, mental health advocates insist the United States is “not keeping track”.

“We’ve deputised America’s police to be mental health workers,” Doris A Fuller, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, told the Guardian. “We’re asking cops to make a split-second decision about whether someone is actually a threat to them.”

On a Facebook page for the Longview police, a user claiming to be Coignard’s uncle wrote that “for quite a few years my niece suffered from mental illness”.

The teenager was taking medication, seeing a therapist and living with her aunt, Heather Robertson, according to an interview with Robertson at ThinkProgress. She told the website that Coignard had struggled with depression and bipolar disorder since her mother’s death when she was four years old. Robertson said her niece had been “only violent with herself”.

“I think it was a cry for help,” Robertson said of the incident in the police department lobby. “I think they could have done something. They are grown men. I think there is something they are not telling us.”

There is video of the killing, Coignard’s aunt said the police told her.

A Longview police spokesperson, Kristie Brian, told the Guardian there are currently no plans to make footage available to the public. She declined to confirm the type of weapon Coignard allegedly brandished but said the department expects to release more details about the shooting later this week. The Texas Ranger Division is investigating the incident.

Brian said Longview officers “are trained in all kinds of different situations”, including dealing with people with mental health problems, and that the county has a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT), which sees specially trained officers dispatched to urgent psychiatric situations. She said she did not know whether the three officers currently on leave had been CIT-trained.

Coignard is the third person – and the third young person – shot dead by Longview police in less than a year. No charges were filed by a grand jury against three officers who killed a 15-year-old robbery suspect during a shootout last March. A 23-year-old cook with a history of making threats died in August after a routine traffic stop went awry. 

Three-and-a-half hours south, in Houston, the 2012 death of Brian Claunch exemplified the potential for tragedy when police with limited training encounter a troubled individual in a pressurised situation. Though Houston has a widely praised CIT programme, two officers without that training were called to a care home one night when Claunch, a schizophrenic, wheelchair-bound double amputee, started behaving erratically.

Police said that he grew violent and cornered an officer while waving a shiny object in their direction. Matthew Marin shot the 45-year-old in the head. The object proved to be a ballpoint pen. In June 2013, a grand jury declined to bring charges against the officer.

That year a police officer in Dallas was dismissed from his job, and indicted by a grand jury in 2014, after he shot a mentally ill man who was holding a knife but standing still several yards away. The encounter lasted less than 30 seconds from the officers’ arrival to the gunfire.

A 2013 joint report by the Treatment Advocacy Center and the National Sheriffs’ Association found that while no national data is officially collected on fatal police shootings of the mentally ill, “multiple informal studies and accounts support the conclusion that ‘at least half of the people shot and killed by police each year in this country have mental health problems’”.

A third of “justifiable homicides”, the study found, could be characterised as “suicide-by-cop”, and many victims were not taking their medications nor under close supervision by mental health agencies.

Not unlike the larger call for more reliable nationwide numbers to address all police killings, advocates say a lack of firm data leads to a standard of police responses to encounters with the mentally ill that depends on officer training and varies widely from department to department.

“We’re not keeping track of that, so we don’t really have a handle on the situation,” said the Treatment Advocacy Center’s Fuller, adding that research indicated about half the US population lives in counties served by CIT policing.

Ron Honberg, national director of policy and legal affairs at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said his organisation has called on the US justice department to keep better track of deaths involving police and the mentally ill. Outgoing attorney general Eric Holder, whose replacement was expected to pass confirmation hearings on Wednesday in Washington, recently called the lack of more comprehensive police incident data “troubling”.

Honberg said the standard police response to someone behaving aggressively is often to “come in and be very assertive, and that can be exactly the wrong way to deal with someone who may be having a serious psychiatric episode” and may have a fear of the authorities.

While better training and protocols are vital, he told the Guardian, at their core the violent encounters are “a manifestation of a broken mental health system”.

Anonymous, in a video posted on Saturday, cited Coignard’s death as the impetus for a new operation called Stop Lethal Force on Children.

“In 2014, we watched as police killed children and it started a army [sic] of angry Americans,” the group said. “This teen girl’s death just put fuel on that fire.”

""I'm in the lobby, and I need some help,"" Kristiana Coignard said into the station telephone at the Longview Police Department.

""OK what kind of help do you need?"" an officer asked. The officer gets no response, and the recording ends.

The same thing happens in a second recording. ""Ma'am, did you just call saying you needed some assistance?"" asks an officer.

""Yes,"" Coignard responds.

""OK, what kind of assistance do you need?"" the officer asks. Again, Coignard is silent on the other end.

Eventually, a Longview Police Department officer would walk into the lobby. A struggle between the officer and Coignard ensued, one that led to her death. Three officers confronted Coignard in the lobby that day and two shot at her. The officers are on paid leave while the Texas Rangers investigate the shooting.

Since the shooting, the Longview Police Department has released video footage, a photograph of a knife they said she was holding during the confrontation and most recently, the audio from the call she made in the police station lobby before the officers came out. But key questions remain about why Coignard was killed and not arrested.

A recurring question from readers comes from a point in the video when Officer Glenn Derr has Coignard held down on the ground, but then backs away and lets her get back up. Why didn't he arrest her at a time when, in the video at least, it looked like he had a chance? That and other specific questions will remain unanswered until after the Texas Rangers complete their investigation, the Longview PD's spokesman says. After the investigation, the Rangers will decide whether to send the case to a grand jury. ""Until then, there's just not a whole lot more we can talk about,"" Longview PD spokesman Kristie Brian says.

Coignard's father, Erik Coignard, and stepmother Elizabeth Canales-Coignard have hired an attorney. In a press conference in San Antonio on Monday morning, the attorney said he was trying to get more facts about what happened the day Coignard died and criticized the police department's tactics.

""If we can achieve one thing, it is that mental illness is a disease that needs to be recognized by police officers,"" attorney Tim Maloney reportedly said.

Chilling surveillance video released a week after the police shooting of a 17-year-old girl in North Texas shows her entering the police department lobby, pulling a knife and facing off against three officers before she is tased and shot.

The Texas Rangers, part of the state Department of Public Safety, are investigating the fatal shooting of Kristiana Coignard on Jan. 22 in Longview, about 130 miles east of Dallas, and the officers involved remained on paid leave, department spokeswoman Kristie Brian said Thursday.

Longview Police Chief Don Dingler defended the officers’ actions amid increased scrutiny surrounding law enforcement's use of deadly force in other cases, including high-profile shootings in Cleveland, New York, Albuquerque and Ferguson, Mo.

The backlash against the department after the shooting included a cyberattack by those claiming to be part of the online activist group Anonymous, which briefly shut down the Longview city website Jan. 24 and posted a critical video on YouTube. Critics of the shooting have used social media to call for a protest Feb. 7 outside the Longview Police Department.

Brian told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday that the hackers took down the website but did not enter it. ""They did attempt to get into our system, but they were not successful,” she said, adding that ""nobody’s information was compromised.”

Video of New Jersey police shooting fuels debate on use of force

Dingler released video of the shooting Wednesday. At a press briefing that day, Brian played the video in slow motion, without sound, and narrated it.

In the video, Coignard can be seen entering the police department lobby at 6:28 p.m., a pale figure with a backpack who approached a phone on the wall.

“That's the phone she did pick up to ask for an officer,” Brian said.

Coignard refused to tell the police dispatcher on the phone what she needed, so the dispatcher sent Officer Glenn Derr to the lobby, Brian said.

Those officers had to make life-or-death decisions in just a split second.
— Kristie Brian, Longview Police Department spokeswoman
“Officer Derr comes in. He's going to attempt to talk to her,” Brian said.

That's when Coignard appeared to hold up her palm.

“She has 'I have a gun' written on her hand,” Brian said.

Derr began to grapple with the teen.

“She says she has a gun, he has to secure her at that point,” Brian said.

The officer can be seen in the video forcing Coignard down onto a bench, then the ground. She kept struggling and eventually reached for the 8-inch knife, Brian said. That’s when the officer backed off, she said.

“He sees the weapon,” Brian said. “She's starting to try to maneuver to get that weapon — it was in her waistband.”

A second officer can then be seen on video entering the lobby, Officer Gene Duffie, then a third, Officer Grace Bagley. Moments later, Coignard charged Derr.

Duffie fired his Taser at the teen “to no effect” the police chief said, then Derr fired three times and Bagley fired twice. Coignard was struck four times.

“Those officers had to make life-or-death decisions in just a split second,” Brian said as the video ended.

All three officers are patrolmen, the chief said, with varying levels of experience. Derr has served with the department for a year, while Bagley have served four years and Duffie 19 years.

Dingler defended the way all three handled the incident.

“What they did is what they were trained to do,” the chief said. “You’ll see from the video that the time was a factor. There was no time for the officers to use other means.”

Once the police investigation concludes, the case will be referred to the  district attorney, he said.

Brian said it was not clear how Coignard traveled to the police department. Video cameras outside show her appearing out of the darkness.

Coignard had apparently been staying with an aunt in Longview, Heather Robertson, who did not return calls or email Thursday.

Robertson previously told the political blog ThinkProgress that her niece had bipolar disorder, had attempted suicide twice but was not violent toward others and that the incident was a “cry for help.”",Yes,Yes,http://www.trbimg.com/img-54caa63f/turbine/la-na-texas-shooting-20150129-001/750/750x422,Yes,http://www.trbimg.com/img-54caa63f/turbine/la-na-texas-shooting-20150129-001/750/750x422,http://www.trbimg.com/img-54c26803/turbine/la-na-new-jersey-police-shooting-20150123/400/400x225,6:28 PM,Indoors,"Government property (e.g. police station, jail)",,Victim made voluntary contact with the police (eg. called for assistance),,None of the above,,Threatening behavior (armed),,No,No,No,No,"Charge/lunge at officer,Fight officer",,"Use TASER,Bring victim to the ground",,Lunged/charged at officer,,,,"Number not given but term ""multiple shots"" used",,Exact number given.

PITTSTON -- A man was shot by a police officer in front of Anthracite Apartments along North Main Street in Pittston.

The question now being asked is if the shooting was justified. People who heard and saw what happened in Luzerne County think the answer is yes.

Police were called to the apartment building around 9 p.m. on Sunday.

According to authorities, a man was waving a gun around outside of the building where elderly, disabled, and low-income residents live.

A teenager in the neighborhood at the time heard what happened. She said police reasoning with the gunman wasn't working.

""The cops pulled up and told the guy six times to put the gun down, put the gun down,"" said Chyanne Saul of Pittston.

A woman told Newswatch 16 that she was driving  when she saw three officers with their guns drawn and pointed at a man.

""He was like, 'drop your weapon, sir. We're not going to hurt you.' That's all I heard, the cop telling the guy to drop his weapon,"" added Maria Dombawski of Pittston.

""I heard someone say, 'drop the gun, drop the gun,'"" recalled Joe Brown, the son of a resident. ""This went on for a short time, maybe three minutes, then a couple minutes after that, six or seven shots rang out.""

Brown was there visiting his mother Sunday night when witnesses say a man with a gun, on the front steps, refused to drop it, and police opened fire.

""They were like in order, 'boom, boom, boom, boom.' And I figured that's coming from one gun. It didn't sound like a gun fight,"" Brown added.

When you look at where the shooting took place, you get the feeling this could have been a whole lot worse. It took place at the top of the steps, right in front of a very busy set of doors on a warm summer night, and adjacent to the Anthracite Apartments' community room.

Only one man was shot, the one who died. The district attorney says the gunshots came from police but no officers were hurt.

Leroy Rekus says he has lived at Anthracite since just after the building opened. He also heard the shots.

""I heard the bang and I looked out and I saw 10 police cars and two ambulances here and everything.""

Both Rekus and Brown say violence there is way out of the ordinary. They feel safe. Brown has no intention of moving his mother to a different apartment, and Rekus said he will stay in the home he's had for about 40 years.

The name of the man shot on Sunday has not been released.

The district attorney's office confirmed, as is customary in cases like this, the local police departments handed off the investigation to the state police and the D.A.'s office.

It's standard procedure to take the officer involved off the street pending the outcome of the investigation, but that is not any indication that he or she did anything wrong.

Police cars block Main Street in Pittston on Sunday night. One person died after a shooting at the Anthracite Apartments.

PITTSTON — One person is dead following a shooting involving police at the Anthracite Apartments on North Main Street on Sunday night, Luzerne County District Attorney Stefanie Salavantis said.

“This is an officer involved shooting. The individual involved is deceased,” Salavantis told the Times Leader.

Information about the victim was not available at press time, and state police and county detectives are conducting the investigation, Salavantis said.

Emergency dispatchers said the incident was reported at about 9 p.m.

The Anthracite Apartments are a multi-story complex located at 101 North Main St. in downtown Pittston. The incident resulted in North Main Street being blocked off between William and Butler streets, with multiple police cars and ambulances called to the scene.

Nick Pearce, whose family owns DeMuro’s Pizza on William Street, said the family has run the shop for 38 years, and it’s always been a very quiet area.

“‘We were cooking and this guy came in and said do you hear pops?” Pearce said. “And then we came outside and heard shots had been fired.”

Investigators were still on the scene early today.

PITTSTON, Pa. - A 77-year-old man on a motorized scooter who pointed what appeared to be a handgun at police officers, refusing their demands to drop it, was shot and killed by them, authorities said.

Robert Patrick Quinn had been waving the realistic-looking pellet gun around outside an apartment complex for elderly, disabled and low-income residents in Pittston on Sunday night when officers arrived, investigators said.

Quinn, who lived at the complex, had recently been diagnosed with cancer, neighbors said. Police said people they interviewed told them he had expressed suicidal intentions.

Witnesses said officers told Quinn to drop the weapon at least six times before they shot him.

""He was like, 'Drop your weapon, sir. We're not going to hurt you.' That's all I heard, the cop telling the guy to drop his weapon,"" Maria Dombawski told WNEP-TV.

Joe Brown, who was visiting his mother at the apartment complex, said officers tried negotiating with Quinn for about three minutes before firing six or seven times.

""They were like in order, 'Boom, boom, boom, boom,'"" Brown said. ""And I figured that's coming from one gun. It didn't sound like a gunfight.""

Two officers fired their weapons, the Luzerne County district attorney's office said.

A heavily breathing officer called for an ambulance and told dispatchers to alert his chief, a state police forensics unit and the district attorney's office, the Times Leader reported.

Luzerne County district attorney rules Pittston police shooting justified
LOCAL

By Ed Lewis - elewis@timesleader.com 

PITTSTON — Luzerne County District Attorney Stefanie Salavantis ruled Tuesday afternoon the deadly police shooting of a disabled 77-year-old man waving what turned out to be a pellet gun was justified.

Salavantis identified the Pittston police officers as Dion Fernandes and Kyle Shumosic.

State police at Wyoming said Robert Patrick Quinn had expressed suicidal intentions by waving the pellet gun when Fernandes and Shumosic encountered him sitting in a motorized scooter smoking a cigarette in front of the Anthracite Apartment building on North Main Street at about 8:46 p.m. Sunday.

Five minutes later, police called for emergency medical technicians to the scene along with Police Chief Robert Powers, a county detective, an assistant district attorney and state police Forensic Services Unit.

Salavantis said multiple witnesses heard Fernandes and Shumosic repeatedly stating, “Sir, please put down the gun.”

Quinn finished smoking his cigarette, stood up and aimed the firearm directly at one of the officers prompting the two officers to discharge their weapons, Salavantis said.

Salavantis said more than 24 interviews were conducted.

Investigators learned Quinn advised a friend to call 911 to report a man with a gun. When the friend asked who had a gun, Quinn replied, “Me,” Salavantis said.

Salavantis stated Quinn had a Marksman 177 pellet gun, a realistic replica of a higher caliber pistol.

Quinn’s estranged wife and friends told investigators Quinn complained of constant pain and had suicidal thoughts for at least 10 years, including thoughts of being shot by police, Salavantis said.

Given the time of the incident just after sunset, there was no way Fernandes and Shumosic knew the firearm he was holding was a pellet gun, Salavantis said.

State police Lt. Richard Krawetz, commander of the criminal investigations unit, said the pellet gun Quinn waved and aimed at the two city officers did not have an orange tip.

Pellet guns and airsoft rifles are excluded under a 1989 federal law that require toy guns to have brightly-colored orange tips to distinguish them from real firearms.

The exclusion creates a life-threatening and dangerous risk for police officers and bystanders, said Dallas Township Police Chief Robert Jolly, president of the Pennsylvania Police Chiefs Association.

“Some of them do look like real weapons even examining them under the bright lights of an office,” Jolly said. “It’s extremely difficult for any police officer, especially at night, who has microseconds to determine if the weapon is a toy, a pellet gun or a real gun. A lot of factors come into play.”

Jolly said the orange tip on toy guns can easily be altered simply by coloring it with a black marker.

“These toy guns and pellet guns, they duplicate the look, feel and appearance of a real gun,” Jolly said.

Earlier this month, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman settled with five major retailers — Amazon.com, Kmart, Sears, Walmart and California-based ACTA — for violating that state’s law prohibiting the sale of “imitation weapons,” toy guns that look like real weapons.

An estimated 6,400 prohibited toy guns were sold in New York without the orange tip from 2012 through 2014, according to a news release from the New York Attorney General’s Office.

The news release says there have been at least 63 shootings in New York State since 1994 as a result of someone holding a toy or imitation weapon. At least eight of those were fatal.

A search of Pennsylvania laws returned no such legislation that bans the sale of toy guns without orange tips. State law requires a person to be 18 years or older to purchase a pellet gun.

Jolly said a buyer of a pellet gun is not subjected to a mandatory three day waiting period, such as the case when an adult purchases a real gun.

While no crime statistics for toy guns and pellet guns exist in Pennsylvania, there was a police-related fatality involving a pellet gun in Wilkes-Barre nearly four years ago.

On Oct. 26, 2011, three city police officers and two Luzerne County sheriff deputies encountered Otha Derrick Green Jr., 29, outside a children’s day care center at North Washington Street and George Avenue. Green was armed with a pellet gun he aimed at the officers, who believed the firearm was real.

Green suffered seven gunshot wounds. He died Nov. 1, 2011, at Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center due to a blood clot in his lung, according to the county Coroner’s Office.

RUIDOSO, N.M. —Ruidoso police fatally shot a man last week.

Timothy Jones, 27, was wielding a sword when officers went to a home for an alleged domestic disturbance, state police said.

According to investigators, Jones aggressively charged toward officers with the sword. Police say they shot him after he ignored requests to drop the sword.

Officers then shot at Jones, who died at the scene.

The officers involved are on standard administrative leave.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Two Ruidoso police officers shot and killed a 27-year-old man because he brandished a sword at the officers and at his mother, according to the New Mexico State Police.

Timothy Jones, 27, was shot and killed by Ruidoso Police Department officers Joseph Bailey and Corporal Lance Ledford Sunday, State Police spokeswoman Elizabeth Armijo said in a news release.

Police say Jones’ mother, 56-year-old Elizabeth Jones, called 911 around 5 a.m. Sunday saying her son wanted to kill her.

When officers arrived, Timothy Jones walked out of a bedroom holding a sword. He “aggressively advanced” toward his mother and the officers, Armijo said. Police told him to drop the sword, but he didn’t. That’s when the two officers shot and killed him.

Bailey and Ledord have been interviewed by New Mexico State Police, who are investigating the shooting.

Two Ruidoso police officers acted justifiably last May when they shot and killed a sword-wielding man who was threatening the officers and his mother, the 12th Judicial District Attorney's office has concluded.

Officers Joseph Bailey and Lance Ledford shot and killed Timothy Jones, 27, on May 17 when he advanced on them, sword in hand as they arrived at his home in response to a 911 call from his mother in which she said she was afraid her son wanted to kill her. Jones ignored orders to drop the sword before he was shot.

An inquiry ensued, and both officers were interviewed immediately after the incident by New Mexico State Police investigators.

The Ruidoso Police Department said in a news release that the case is now closed.

SOMERSET, Pa. - A state trooper investigating a burglary at a western Pennsylvania grocery store Friday fatally shot the suspect when he pointed what turned out to be a BB gun at him, police said.

Two troopers responded to a burglar alarm at the Save-A-Lot grocery store in Somerset around 4 a.m. and found the rear door pried open, state police said.

While searching the store, one trooper heard a noise in a dark storage area and confronted Lowrey, who was wearing dark clothing and holding a black handgun, police said. Lowrey was ordered to drop the weapon, but instead he pointed it at the trooper, police said. The trooper fired, hitting Lowrey in the torso, state police said.

It was only after the shooting that troopers realized the weapon was a BB gun, police said.

“In the pictures it looks exactly like a handgun would look. Very alarming,” said Trooper Steve Limani.

Three active warrants were out for Lowrey in connection to other burglaries, according to police. He may have had ties to dozens more.

“We're thinking upwards of 30 other incidents that he may have been involved in,” said Somerset County District Attorney Lisa Lazzari-Strasiser.

State police have investigated reported burglaries over the past several months in the area where the grocery store is located, police said.

On Wednesday, they said, video surveillance cameras recorded a man wearing dark clothing and apparently armed with a handgun forcibly entering a store adjacent to the grocery store around the same time of day.

State police said their investigation is continuing.

The troopers were not identified. The trooper who shot Lowrey was an 11-year veteran of the state police and was not hurt, state police said.",Yes,No,,No,,http://www.wpxi.com/news/local/troopers-shoot-person-inside-grocery-store/46225323,http://www.wtae.com/news/burglary-suspect-shot-by-psp-troopers-in-somerset/33166642,Burglary suspect shot dead by police at Somerset grocery store,"Burglary suspect shot dead by police at Somerset grocery store

Michael J. Lowrey, 40, was found armed with the firearm in a rear break area at Save-A-Lot on North Center Avenue when troopers responded to an alarm about 4 a.m., Trooper Steve Limani said.

An image of a burglar carrying a gun had been caught on security camera video at a different store nearby just two days ago. Pennsylvania State Police say that when the burglar alarm went off at Somerset Save-a-Lot, the troopers headed inside the  store knew that danger could also be present there.

The trooper's use of deadly force is a classic shoot/don't-shoot decision scenario.

""If he's in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death, he has the right to protect himself and the people around him by using -- in this particular case you would call it --  lethal force,"" said Limani.

The two troopers responding to the alarm discovered a door had been pried open at the back of the building, then heard sounds of someone inside.

As they conducted a sweep through Save-a-Lot, one of the troopers encountered a man dressed in dark clothing in the darkened break room of the store. The trooper who encountered a sudden danger had to make his decision in an instant.

""He (the suspected burglar) had a handgun on him. That trooper confronted the subject, requested that he relinquish his handgun and put down the gun. That suspect did not comply with the request of the trooper. The trooper engaged him with gunfire,"" Limani, said.

He shot and killed Lowrey, who was wanted for three burglaries in the Somerset area and was a suspect in many more.

""We're thinking upwards of maybe 30 other incidents that he would have been involved in,"" said Somerset County District Attorney Lisa Lazzari-Strasiser.

""When they did a further examination of the firearm, they found it was actually a BB gun that was black in color,"" said Limani. ""It looks exactly like an handgun would look. It's very alarming. And those pictures do resemble pictures were able to take from other video surveillance footage.""

Police released photos of Lowrey's weapon illustrating what the trooper was facing in the instant the firearm was pointed at him.

""It's my responsibility to make the decision on the officers' conduct,"" said  Lazzari-Strasiser. ""They are cleared  as far as prosecutorial decisions on my part,"" pending a final written report.

The trooper, whose identity was not released by state police, remains on paid administrative leave during the review of the incident.

Shoppers arriving at the temporarily closed store expressed sympathy for the trooper.

""He has to do what's instinctively correct of a response,"" said shopper Lloyd Strang of Somerset. ""You don't have time to mace or do anything other than to protect yourself against a handgun.""

""My heart goes out to the police. They're putting themselves on the line for everybody,"" said his wife, Anne Strang. ""This man had no business being there and the policeman was doing his job.""

""We are saddened by the events  that have transpired. I think that the state police that were on site did an excellent job in their investigation,"" Bill Lingle,the owner of the Save-a-Lot, told Pittsburgh's Action News 4.

ANGLETON — Calls for healing and prayer for all involved have followed a Brazoria County grand jury’s decision to clear the Freeport police officer who shot and killed a man last month.

The grand jury Thursday took no action on Officer Christian Flores, who killed Ronald Sneed on Jan. 7 after police responded to a disturbance call at an apartment complex in the 300 block of Yaupon Street in Freeport.

“We’re obviously glad this part of it is over. Hopefully the healing process for everyone touched by this can continue to move forward,” said Freeport Police Chief Dan Pennington, who spoke on Flores’ behalf.

The shooting followed a 911 call to police saying Sneed, 31, had kicked in the door of the apartment unit and was refusing to leave, police said. He often shared this home with his common-law wife, Beatrice Myers, officials said.

When they arrived, officers found Sneed with a gun sitting on the bed next to where Myers was lying. Flores fired his weapon when he said Sneed pointed the gun at Myers, a detail the woman would later confirm with investigators in sworn written and oral statements.

The incident still sparked controversy throughout the city. Frustrated protesters gathered at the police department on multiple occasions, calling the shooting unjust and decrying police tactics.

Rumors contradicting police statements also began to circulate. Myers herself contributed to this by publicly reversing her original statements on multiple occasions.

One of the incident’s most vocal protesters was Pastor Lacorey Harris, who led about 12 of Sneed’s family and friends on one last march around the Brazoria County Courthouse on Jan. 21.

The activist said Thursday the grand jury’s decision did not surprise him, and offered prayers to the Sneed, Myers and Flores families.

“I applaud the Freeport Police Department for their transparency with me on this matter, and I hope our paths do not cross again,” he said.

Harris said he hoped the city’s residents would show Flores respect as he returns to the force. He declined further comment.

Sneed’s mother, Sarah Bass, spoke at the courthouse protest Jan. 21, describing her son as a gentle man and demanding more answers for what occurred in the apartment that day.

Contact information for Myers and Bass was not readily available Thursday night.

The protests began to subside as the Brazoria County District Attorney’s Office released information on the case to the public, including the original 911 call and both of Myers’ sworn statements.

“The actions of the Freeport Police Department were justified, necessary and saved the lives of innocent citizens,” District Attorney Jeri Yenne said Thursday in a written statement.

Pennington said the grand jury’s decision does bring a sense of relief, especially considering the hours the grand jury goes through analyzing evidence before making a decision.

“Any time you pass that level of scrutiny, there’s always some validation that accompanies your actions,” he said.

Flores returned to the force Jan. 21.

Pennington said the incident will probably stay with the second-year officer, but believed he could still use the experience to better himself.

“Like everything in life, it’s a learning process,” he said. “I’m sure there are several lessons that he will take with him as he moves forward.”",No,,,,,,http://abc13.com/news/suspect-killed-in-officer-involved-shooting-in-freeport/465806/,SUSPECT KILLED IN OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING IN FREEPORT,"SUSPECT KILLED IN OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING IN FREEPORT

Neighbors and family members say Ron Sneed, 32, was arguing with his longtime girlfriend when an officer who was investigating a disturbance call kicked in the door and began firing his weapon. Relatives also tell us Sneed has been in trouble in the past and has been in jail, but they claim he was doing nothing wrong and was unarmed when a Freeport officer shot him four times and killed him.

""My son, he was a person and not a dog,"" said Sarah Sneed Bass, the dead man's mother. ""They shot him down four times in the head. That, to me, that was assassination by the police.""

Police say that's not exactly what happened. They say when the officer entered the apartment, he saw Sneed pointing a gun at his girlfriend's face.

""The officer saw he had a pistol in his hand,"" said Captain Raymond Garivey of the Freeport Police Department. ""At that time, the suspect then turned and pointed the gun at the female, at her direction, at which time, fearing for her safety and her life, one of our officers discharged his weapon, striking the suspect.""

Activist Quanell X came to Freeport police station, as tensions spilled over from the scene, with about 100 friends, family members and residents who wanted answers. He told those gathered that they needed to go home and that Sneed was not killed in cold blood and that the shooting was not out of line.


""It's tragic, I'll be the first one to say let's protest, let's crank this place up, let's go against these crooked cops, if this was the case,"" Quanell X said. ""But this is not the case.""

FREEPORT, Texas – Police shot and killed a man holding his girlfriend at gunpoint inside her apartment.

Ronald Sneed, 31, ignored commands to drop the weapon, investigators said.

Sneed's death initially angered family, friends and neighbors in the 300 block of Yaupon Street in Freeport Wednesday morning. Many followed activist Quannell X to the police department. Some held up their hands with the words ""Don't Shoot"" written on their palms.


Things changed when the crowd heard the facts.

""I'd be the first one to say let's protest,"" Quannell X told the crowd. ""(I'd say) let's crank this place up. Let's go against these crooked cops if this was the case. But, this is not the case.""

Sneed often stayed with his girlfriend and her three children inside the woman's apartment. However, the couple argued over text messages found on the woman's phone Tuesday.

One day later, Sneed was still angry and locked out. Investigators said he kicked open his girlfriend's door. The woman's son called for help, police said.

Officer Christian Flores, a two year veteran, responded first. He went inside and found Sneed straddling his girlfriend on a bed, investigators said. When warned over and over to raise his hands, Sneed instead raised a handgun, police said. He aimed it at his girlfriend's face. So, Officer Flores opened fire.

""(Sneed's girlfriend) had her children in harm's way, she was in harm's way and, like I told you, she praised the officer for saving her life,"" said Freeport Police Captain Raymond Garivey.

Still, Sneed's death stirred rumor and emotion. However, after Quannell X and Sneed's mother met with Freeport's police chief, protesters went home.

""Based on my experience with these kinds of cases, I think the brother snapped,"" Quannell X told the crowd.

""We respect people's opinions as far as wanting to make sure that people in authority are doing their jobs correctly,"" Garivey said. ""We totally respect that. What we ask of the public is to not pass judgment so quickly based on rumors.""

Sneed's family now agrees. They also believe Officer Flores had no choice.

Jonathan Ryan Paul (Arlington PD)
Jonathan Ryan Paul (Arlington PD)
Update at 4:30 p.m. March 13 by Robert Wilonsky: Arlington police say that Jonathan Ryan Paul was pronounced dead just before 3:30 p.m today.

Sgt. Jeffrey Houston, Arlington PD spokesman, says via email that “criminal and administrative investigations continue.” Which means that investigators “are looking into the actions of everyone involved” from the moment Paul was brought into the Arlington City Jail Monday and placed in an isolation cell Tuesday.

But, Houston says, “we’re really waiting on the medical examiner” to determine manner and cause of death.

Original item posted at 5:07 p.m. March 12: An Arlington man who was arrested was hospitalized after officers found him unresponsive in his cell earlier this week.

Jonathan Ryan Paul, 42, was arrested Monday on multiple outstanding misdemeanor warrants after police responded to Paul’s apartment in the 300 block of East Mitchell Street about 4:15 a.m. on a disturbance call.

Witnesses reported that Paul was screaming and throwing items out of an upstairs window. He was arrested after officers determined he had outstanding warrants, police said.

On Tuesday, police said Paul continued to be agitated and non-compliant. He was restrained and placed in an isolation cell at the Arlington City jail where detention officers saw that he had become unresponsive. They called EMS about 5 p.m.

He remains in intensive care at Arlington Memorial Hospital.

Police are not releasing the video from the cell where Paul was held until administrative and criminal investigations have been completed.

FORT WORTH 
Physical restraints and the use of pepper spray played a significant role in the death of a man four days after he was arrested by Arlington police, according to his autopsy report.

Officials with the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office ruled that Jonathan Ryan Paul, 42, died an “in-custody death with application of physical restraints” while listing acute psychosis as a contributing factor. The manner of death has not been determined.

The recently released report says that the psychosis left Paul, who was washing himself with toilet water and howling while in jail, vulnerable to sudden death during restraint.

The autopsy also concludes that jailers followed department protocol.

Luis Bartolomei, the attorney representing Paul’s family, said there are unanswered questions in the report that he hopes will be made clear by the videotape of Paul’s time in the Arlington jail.

“How does psychosis leave a man vulnerable to sudden death?” Bartolomei asked. “It seems as though this report was written in such a way to be interpreted in a light most favorable to the Police Department.”

The report says Paul’s psychosis would most likely be treatable with a medical evaluation and care at a hospital.

Paul’s cousin Bobbie Waters said she does not understand how a man she remembers as vital, energetic and good fell so far, so fast.

“His mom is not here and his dad is not here,” Waters said during a recent interview. “His mom was dear to me. She and my mom were close growing up and Jonathan was dear to me. I owe it to her to find out what happened.”

Bartolomei has filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the family.

Paul was arrested March 9 on outstanding warrants by Arlington police who were responding to a disturbance call, according to authorities. Waters said her relatives told her later that Paul suffered two heart attacks and a collapsed lung while he was in the hospital and finally succumbed to brain death. The decision to remove Paul from life support was made four days after he was detained in the Arlington jail, Waters said.

‘I am the lion king’

Video of the jail’s confinement area where Paul was held has not been released, Bartolomei said.

“The police have had the video for more than three months and if there is nothing there then why not release it?” Bartolomei said. “We’re not debating that he was disruptive that evening. But within 24 hours he goes from healthy to being unresponsive in jail and is taken to the hospital and dies? If anyone can interpret that in any other way than he was killed I would be surprised.”

Excerpts from the autopsy report depict a troubled man the day after his arrest.

“Physical restraint and pepper spray are used by jailers as they attempted to release handcuffs from Paul. After release, video shows Paul undressing and dressing multiple times, washing his body with toilet water, pacing the cell and acting like he is shooting a gun. … He floods the cell with water and is noted to be howling and yelling, including, ‘I am the lion king!’ … He will not follow instructions; he is pepper-sprayed in the face and forcibly removed from the cell by four jailers.”

After being restrained and handcuffed, Paul began struggling again, but a few minutes later, at 5:52 p.m., a jailer says that “Paul’s breathing is very shallow” and 911 is called.

Arlington paramedics arrived about 6 p.m. and began treatments four minutes later but found no pulse, the report said. Eight minutes after paramedics arrived Paul had a heart attack, but he was shocked once and regained his pulse about 6:20 p.m. At 6:33 p.m. Paul arrived at the Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital emergency room, the report said.

Shortly before 10 p.m. Paul was transferred to the hospital’s intensive care unit and diagnosed with a kidney injury, respiratory failure, liver failure and a temperature of more than 103 degrees.

Cannabinoids, evidence that Paul used marijuana, were found during a toxicology screening, according to the report.

DA’s office reviewing case

Arlington police have declined to comment on the investigation and have forwarded the investigative file to the Tarrant County district attorney’s office for review. An official with the DA’s office said that review is ongoing and officials will decide whether the case will be presented to a grand jury.

A critical case review was conducted by officials with the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office on May 26, which states the following:

“Sudden in-custody deaths are often multifactorial and can involve physical restraint, acute psychosis, use of drugs and alcohol, use of pepper spray and underlying medical conditions. Paul had no known past psychiatric history. It is unclear exactly when Mr. Paul stopped breathing.”

Paul was arrested after officers were called to his apartment in the 300 block of East Mitchell Street because of a disturbance. When they arrived, they heard Paul yelling and saw broken windows, Arlington police said in news release. Officers were told that Paul had been throwing items out of an upstairs window.

Officers determined that Paul was wanted on multiple misdemeanor warrants. He was arrested after officers tried several times to speak with him, the release said.

Waters described Paul as fun-loving and energetic, more like a big brother to her than a cousin. Going to his funeral when he was only 42 was unnerving, Waters said.

“I’m not doing this to try and badger the police,” Waters said. “They are heroes and they risk their lives and do a lot for us. But what was done to Jonathan Paul was not right. It’s obvious that a crime occurred in the jailhouse, and whoever was involved in that crime needs to be held accountable.”

Two police jailers in Texas have been indicted on charges of criminally negligent homicide over the death of Jonathan Paul in police custody.

Paul, 42, was found unresponsive in his cell on 12 March, three days after he was arrested by police. An autopsy found he had had been physically restrained and pepper-sprayed before his death, although a medical examiner could not determine a cause of death.

A Tarrant county grand jury indicted one current and one former Arlington police jailer on Monday evening. Pedro Medina was placed on paid administrative leave based on the grand jury’s decision, police said. The other officer involved, Stephen Schmidt, retired from the department in October.

Officers arrested Paul in March after responding to a disturbance call where they found Paul shouting and throwing things out of a window, according to authorities. They took him into custody after learning he had outstanding warrants.

Police said on Monday evening that an internal investigation should be finished within two weeks.

“This has been a difficult case for our community,” said Will Johnson, Arlington police chief. “We promised a thorough and vigorous investigation into this matter. Now that the grand jury proceeding has concluded we are eager to finalize the administrative case and present the findings of the investigation to the family and our community.”

Paul’s family has filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit alleging that detention officers used “excessive and undue force by physically restraining Jonathan Paul around the neck and compressing his airways, which caused him to stop breathing”.",Yes,Yes,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145a25810aa2c3987f7a98172d3eb57504aef8b9/0_0_960_576/master/960.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=925af3cef27c6c6adad5b83b0b6661c1,No,,NONE,Yes,http://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/arlington/article71494962.html,"Arlington council OKs $1.25 million settlement in jail inmate’s death

ARLINGTON 
The City Council on Tuesday night approved a $1.25 million settlement with the family of a 42-year-old man who died last year after he struggled with Arlington jailers and collapsed in his cell.

The council voted 9-0 without discussion, as part of the consent agenda, to approve the mediated settlement in the death of Jonathan Ryan Paul.

“The city of Arlington is pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable settlement with the Jonathan Paul estate,” the city said in a statement released early Tuesday. “Because of the ongoing criminal investigations, the city has no further comment on any claims of the estate at this time.”

Paul was arrested March 9 on outstanding warrants by Arlington officers responding to a disturbance call. He was taken to the city’s jail. He became disruptive at some point, and on March 10, physical restraints and pepper spray were used to subdue him, according to an autopsy report. He collapsed in his jail cell and was taken to Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital. He died March 13 after his family removed life support.

Physical restraints and the use of pepper spray played a significant role in Paul’s death, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office, which listed acute psychosis as a contributing factor. The ME’s report said that Paul’s psychosis would most likely have been treatable with a medical evaluation and care at a hospital.

The family sued the city in federal court in May, saying that when Arlington officials became aware of Paul’s medical problems, they were deliberately indifferent to his needs and denied him the medical care that might have saved his life.

Marvin Phillips, one of Paul’s uncles, called the financial settlement “a slap on the hand.”

“Hopefully that will cause some changes in how they treat human beings,” Phillips said.

The parties met in “pre-suit mediation” in March and tentatively agreed to a full settlement of the claims, subject to City Council approval, according to a staff document. The settlement will be funded through the city’s self-insurance and risk management program.

“I’m glad the city came to an agreement,” said Thomas Kelly, a longtime friend. “But it was never about the money to me. It’s about justice. Somebody needs to account for this man, for a senseless death that didn’t have to happen.

“I’m afraid that nothing’s going to happen to anyone, and they’re going to brush it all under the table. That’s my biggest fear.”

HOPEFULLY THAT WILL CAUSE SOME CHANGES IN HOW THEY TREAT HUMAN BEINGS.
Marvin Phillips, uncle of Jonathan Ryan Paul

Before the vote, Alisa Simmons, president of the Arlington branch of the NAACP, told the council that in cases like Paul’s, the NAACP will advocate for better initial screening and oversight during the jail booking process, restrained physical response and medical care throughout.

“The NAACP expects continued dialogue with the Arlington Police Department in order to examine and improve its protocols and training in situations involving African-Americans, in addition to people who suffer from mental illness,” Simmons said.

Two jailers — Pedro Medina and Steve Schmidt — were indicted on charges of criminally negligent homicide in Paul’s death.

The indictments say that Medina and Schmidt physically restrained Paul in a way that kept him from being able to breathe, used pepper spray excessively and neglected to provide or render timely medical assistance to Paul.

Trial dates for Medina, 33, and Schmidt, 57, have not been set.

Schmidt retired Oct. 22, 2015, after spending 10 years as a jailer. He was lead detention officer at the time of Paul’s death.

In addition to being indicted, Medina was fired along with two other jailers, Wes Allen and Matt Fisher.

“All three have requested arbitration,” city spokeswoman Susan Schrock said Tuesday. “The city is working with opposing counsel to get that scheduled.”

Possible bullet holes frame the residence of Lionel Kerns on Monday, the day after he was fatally shot by law enforcement after a domestic disturbance call.
DEKALB COUNTY, Mo. — Troopers with the Missouri State Highway Patrol identified the subject who was shot and killed by law enforcement in DeKalb County on Sunday morning.

Lionel Kerns, 53, of Stewartsville, Missouri, was shot after he failed to comply with officers with the Missouri State Highway Patrol and the DeKalb County Sheriff’s Department shortly after 10:15 a.m. Sunday. Officers responded to Mr. Kerns’ residence, located in the 10200 block of Southwest Thornton Road, after a reported domestic disturbance at the residence.

“We have been working as an agency in conjunction with the DeKalb County Sheriff’s Department and our Division of Drug and Crime Control to make sure we positively identify the suspect,” said Sgt. Jacob Angle with the Missouri State Highway Patrol. “The autopsy was scheduled for (Monday) morning, officers attended that from both departments, and, of course, those results will be forthcoming.”

Troopers and deputies arrived at the residence outside of Stewartsville with information that the subject was possibly armed with a firearm.

“It is not unusual when we have calls in the county for assistance, especially in domestic situations,” Mr. Angle said. “Anytime we respond to a situation, a domestic disturbance or anything, you never know if weapons are involved or not ... and in this case we did know there was going to be a possible weapon involved; it’s not uncommon at all for the county to request for backup.”

Upon making contact with Mr. Kerns, troopers reported that he was armed with a rifle and pointed it at officers. After Mr. Kerns was told to put the firearm down, officers said he continued to point the weapon at them, prompting shots to be fired at Mr. Kerns.

Mr. Kerns was killed in the shooting. The female who was reportedly involved in the disturbance was in a neighboring mobile home at the time of the shooting and was not injured.

“We’ve been reviewing the officers’ videos there on the scene,” Mr. Angle said, in order to fully process the timeline and circumstances involved in the fatal shooting.

Mr. Angle said officers still are collecting evidence as to how many shots were fired and which officer fired the fatal shot, pending autopsy reports. The responding trooper was placed on administrative leave, per protocol while officers investigate the shooting.

On Monday, the residence of the shooting remained quiet in the dreary weather. Two trailers on the property were surrounded by purple markings, possibly evidence of a crime-scene investigation from the previous day.

The shooting remained under investigation.

STEWARTSVILLE, Mo. • A northwest Missouri man is dead after pointing a weapon at law enforcement officers who were responding to a domestic disturbance, police said.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol says the patrol and Dekalb County Sheriff's Department responded to a call near Stewartsville at 10:18 a.m. Sunday when they made contact with a man armed with a weapon. Stewartsville is about 240 miles northwest of St. Louis, near St. Joseph, Mo.

The officers ordered the man to drop the weapon but opened fire after he pointed the gun at the officers, the patrol said.

Officers with the Missouri State Highway Patrol and deputies with the DeKalb County Sheriff’s Department investigate an officer-involved shooting in rural DeKalb County last November.
MAYSVILLE, Mo. — Charges will not be filed in the November shooting of a DeKalb County man after a prosecutor completed his review of a Missouri State Highway Patrol investigation into the incident.

Prosecutor Eric Tate said Monday no charges will be filed against any of the four officers in the Nov. 29 shooting death of 53-year-old Lionel Kerns of Stewartsville, Missouri.

Authorities released new details of the shooting Monday.

“It happened incredibly fast,” Tate said.

On the day in question, two Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers and two DeKalb County deputies were responding to reports of an armed domestic disturbance. Kerns’ wife called DeKalb County 911 saying her husband was armed and wanting to shoot somebody or be shot by officers.

After listening to the tapes, reading the investigation and talking at length with his deputies, DeKalb County Sheriff Wes Raines told the News-Press he personally believed this was a case of “death by cop.”

“That’s what it looks like, suicide by cop,” Raines said. “That’s exactly what it looks like.”

The investigation by the Highway Patrol’s Drug and Crime Control Unit of Troop H didn’t draw any conclusions but it did reveal the facts, Tate said.

Kerns had a 22-cal. long rifle, which held 18 bullets and still had 17 after the shooting, Tate said.

The wife mumbled and cried a lot while talking to a 911 communicator. She did say she hadn’t been harmed by her husband.

Kerns barricaded himself and his wife in one of the trailers, and she was crying hysterically, Tate said.

By five seconds after 10:36 a.m. Nov. 29, the four officers were arriving on the scene.

At 34 seconds after 10:36 a.m., a trooper shouted at Kerns to “drop the gun, drop the gun, drop it, drop the gun.”

The prosecutor said Kerns was standing in the open aiming his rifle at officers, but he didn’t know who fired first.

Shots were fired. The report said a total of nine shots were fired: one by Kerns, five by Highway Patrol officer Jonathon Lynch and three by a DeKalb County reserve deputy identified as Kyle Schmitz.

The last shot appears to have been fired at 40 seconds after 10:36 a.m.

From the eight shots fired by law enforcement, Kerns was shot in the thigh, twice in the arm and once in the right scalp, Tate said.

Details about the shot in the right scalp, fired by Schmitz, proved it was the fatal shot.

An autopsy report from Frontier Forensics Midwest revealed Kerns had a blood alcohol level of .126. The doctor’s summary stated “The decedent expires as a consequence of multiple gunshot injuries.

“The injury isn’t survivable and destroys the right side of pons and medulla, causing immediate loss of voluntary function and immediate death,” the doctor stated.

Schmitz is a part-time deputy who was off duty at the time. He responded to a radio dispatch from the other deputy because he was near the scene and could be there to assist, Raines said.

Tate said the Highway Patrol investigation was thorough, and he found no cause to file any charges against any officer involved in the shooting.

PORTAGE, MI — As Sean Pelletier rode in the front seat of a red Acura fleeing police, officers said it appeared he was loading an AK-47 rifle.

With his younger brother, Aaron, at the wheel, the Pelletiers led police on a chase across Portage until numerous cruisers boxed them in, leading to a final, chaotic confrontation that left Sean dead and Aaron critically wounded.

The scenario is depicted in a batch of Portage Public Safety reports and dash cam videos that the department released Friday afternoon. They shed new light on the May 14 police chase and fatal shooting of Sean Pelletier at Anna's Vineyard Apartments off of Milham Avenue on the west side of Portage.

Sean Pelletier was wanted on a trespassing warrant and had used firearms to threaten people at his mother's Portage house where he lived and refused to vacate, authorities have said. He was under surveillance by the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office, which had decided to attempt to arrest Pelletier away from the house on Rayborn Court.

Portage is the first agency to release reports on the incident. Earlier Friday, the Michigan State Police, which is leading the investigation, issued a short statement saying the investigation was ongoing but offered little new information.

The Portage reports and videos provide some new details and paint the picture of an agency that was called in to assist after the chase had begun at about 12:48 p.m. May 14.

The dash cam of one Portage police car shows the scene on Milham Avenue as cruisers worked to box in the Pelletiers. The Acura is seen turning around and getting rammed by a Kalamazoo Public Safety cruiser before gun shots are heard.

A Michigan conservation officer who had joined the pursuit said he saw a Kalamazoo Public Safety officer outside his vehicle firing at the Acura, according to a Portage police officer who interviewed the conservation officer.

The conservation officer said it looked ""like the driver had been hit by gunfire from the KDPS officer as the front seat passenger in the suspect vehicle began steering the suspect vehicle into the apartment complex,"" the Portage report says.

As police vehicles continued the pursuit into the complex, numerous gunshots can be heard. By the time the first Portage police cruiser reaches the scene, Sean Pelletier had exited his vehicle and can be seen in the distance, upright on the ground.

Police opened fire after Sean Pelletier exited the car with what investigators described as a ""high-powered military-style rifle,"" Michigan State Police have said.

Another round of gunfire erupts before Sean Pelletier falls completely to the ground and drops his weapon. Police then converge on the suspects.

Aaron Pelletier was found wounded in the driver's seat. He remains in critical condition at Bronson Methodist Hospital. 

At least two bullets went through the window of an apartment. One resident went into a panic attack during the shooting and police later found a broke picture frame on a living room wall and an ""unknown impact mark/hole"" on an adjacent wall.

No one other than the Pelletiers was injured in the incident.

According to the reports, Portage officers were first alerted to the pursuit when the Acura was southbound on 35th Street near MN Avenue. The Acura turned west on Kilgore Road and then south on Sprinkle Road.

""As information was received that the pursuit was continuing west on Kilgore Rd toward Sprinkle, I repositioned to the parking lot of Mann-Hummel on Sprinkle Rd north of Romence to position myself for possible stop stick deployment,"" one Portage officer wrote in his incident report.

""At this time, I overhead KCSD traffic indicating the occupants appeared to be loading an AK-47 rifle in the vehicle,"" the officer continued. ""As I was donning the ballistic armor plate carrier at the rear of my vehicle, the pursuit passed SB on Sprinkle in front of me.""

The Acura turned west on Romence.

""Please note that I had overheard radio traffic from pursuing units indicating that a subject in the vehicle that was being chased was in possession of an AK-47,"" another Portage officer reported. ""It was further learned that the driver of the suspect vehicle was attempting to ram into Officers who were in the process of attempting to deploy stop sticks.""

Portage police, who had been working with the county in an attempt to evict Pelletier from his mother's house on Rayborn Court, said they believed the brothers were attempting to get to the house.

The Acura turned north on Angling Road and then west on Milham Avenue, putting them on a path to return home.

After driving over the U.S. 131 overpass on Milham, Aaron Pelletier made a U-turn at Downey Street, apparently in response to being blocked by police cruisers, according to the reports. 

The dash cam video shows a long line of police vehicles, facing east and west on Milham, as the Acura attempts to circumvent them.

After the initial shots are fired on Milham, the car proceeds into the apartment complex where Sean Pelletier is shot and killed. 

On the pavement near Sean Pelletier, who was wearing a red flannel shirt, was a rifle with a wooden stock and ""at least two handgun magazines,"" one Portage officer wrote.

Michigan State Police have previously said that officers from Kalamazoo Public Safety, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office and the state police fired their weapons. A total of six officers, none from Portage, discharged their guns during the incident. 

Another Portage report gives historical information that led to the confrontation with the Pelletiers. 

The report says officers worked with Christine Pelletier, the mother who owned the property, for the past eight months.

""She was forced out of her residence by her children and was attempting to serve eviction on them,"" the report says. ""Several attempts by the Sheriff's Department to serve the eviction resulted in volatile situations with the residents being armed."" 

On several occasions, Christine Pelletier attempted intervention and mediation through Kalamazoo Community Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services ""resulting in no response from the adult children,"" the report says.

Sean, Aaron and two of their sisters were living in the house on Rayborn Court. Sean and sister Amy, the older two, ""controlled the movements"" of the two younger siblings, the report says.

Based on communication from their mother and their own contacts with Sean, police said ""it was evident that both were suffering from a mental crisis demonstrating paranoia and fear of being watched or targeted to be killed.""

PORTAGE, Mich. (NEWSCHANNEL 3) - We're uncovering new information about a police chase involving a pair of brothers, which ended in a hail of gunfire--leaving one man dead and another fighting for his life.

Newschannel 3 is also getting a look at dramatic dash cam video, as chaos erupted in a quiet apartment complex.

The video, along with the police report, shows just how scary the chase and subsequent shooting was--especially for those caught in the middle of it.

What started off as an ongoing eviction dispute turned into a pursuit involving 37-year-old Sean Pelletier, of Portage.

According to the police report, he had a history of volatile confrontations with police, and a stash of weapons, so deputies decided to try to take him into custody away from his home.

But the attempt to pull his car over turned into a chase involving Portage Police, Kalamazoo Public Safety, and the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department.

The pursuit went on for about 25 miles, before coming to a head at the Anna's Vineyard apartment complex.

The red Acura, being driven by Sean's brother, 29-year-old Aaron Pelletier, zig-zagged between cruisers on Milham, crashing into one of them but still moving, before turning into the complex.

Almost immediately, you can hear rapid gunfire. According to the police report, some of those bullets hit cars, while others hit apartments.

In one case, a young man suffered a panic attack when a bullet flew through his wall as he was crawling to take cover.

Police say once the car came to a stop, Sean Pelletier got out, armed with a high-powered military-style rifle, aimed in the direction of officers.

Police then opened fire, killing Sean, and wounding Aaron.

The police report adds that Sean had a pouch on his belt filled with ammunition.

According to the report, he was paranoid, and believed he was being watched or targeted to be killed.

The two sisters also named as part of the eviction are still in the house, and Aaron Pelletier remains hospitalized.

State Police say their investigation is ongoing.

KALAMAZOO, MI – Six police officers were justified when they fired their weapons at Sean and Aaron Pelletier following a lengthy police chase that came to an end in Portage in May, Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting said.

The officers – a Michigan State Police trooper, two Kalamazoo Public Safety officers, two Kalamazoo County sheriff's deputies and a sheriff's detective – fired a total of 50 rounds at the brothers on May 14 at Anna's Vineyard Apartments off Milham Avenue.

Sean Pelletier, 37, was killed and Aaron Pelletier, 29, was wounded in the head and hospitalized in critical condition.

Getting issued findings of his investigation into the officer-involved shooting Friday during a press conference at his office. He reviewed a rougly 20-mile pursuit of the Pelletiers, who were armed in a car and refused to stop for officers.

""I think it is obvious ... that this was a tense, rapidly evolving situation,"" Getting said.

""All of the efforts by the police agencies were met with defiance,"" he said.

""It is my conclusion (the officers) were justified in their actions on May 14, 2015. As a result, no charges will be filed ... against any of them.""

The press conference came almost six months after the incident, which began when MSP Trooper Michael Daniels attempted to stop an Acura driven by Aaron Pelletier just off I-94 in Galesburg.

What followed was a 25-minute pursuit during which speeds reached as high as 60 mph.

Prior to the police pursuit, investigators from the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office had been conducting surveillance near the Pelletiers' home on Raborn Court in Portage when they spotted Sean and Aaron leaving the house, according to a Michigan State Police report the Kalamazoo Gazette obtained in July under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act.

Sean Pelletier was wanted on a trespassing warrant and police said he had used guns to threaten people at the Raborn Court house, which belonged to his mother, Christine Pelletier. Christine Pelletier was seeking to have her son and two daughters evicted from the house but they refused to leave.

On May 30, more than two weeks after Sean Pelletier was killed, his sisters, Amy and Michelle Pelletier, were arrested at the Raborn Court house after a standoff with police. The incident began when police received reports of gunshots being fired near the Pelletiers' house.

After the Pelletier sisters were arrested May 30, police said investigators found 27 guns inside the house on Raborn Court.

In October, Michelle Pelletier, 34, was found guilty in October of two counts of resisting and obstructing police in the May 30 standoff. She's scheduled to be sentenced Monday by Circuit Judge Paul J. Bridenstine, who presided over her bench trial.

Amy Pelletier, who faces the same charges as her sister, has yet to stand trial.

In the May 14 incident, sheriff's investigators were attempting to arrest Sean Pelletier away from the Raborn Court address on.


Police chase, fatal shooting of Sean Pelletier in Portage
Dash-camera footage released by Michigan State police captured the May 14, 2015, police chase and fatal shooting of Sean Pelletier in Portage.
During the pursuit, a sheriff's sergeant attempted to pin the Pelletiers' car, which was being driven by Aaron Pelletier, near the intersection of N Avenue and Sprinkle Road. During that point in the pursuit, the sergeant spotted what he believed to be an AK-47 in the hands of Sean Pelletier, who was in the car's passenger seat.

A MSP trooper who initiated the pursuit that day noted the sergeant's warning in the report obtained by the Gazette and said he saw the barrel of a long gun sticking out of the passenger window at that point in the pursuit.

The pursuit eventually came to an end at Anna Vineyard Apartments on West Milham Avenue.

At that point, a Kalamazoo Public Safety officer fired 10 round at the Acura as he stood in the road just outside the entrance to the apartment complex.

The gunfire blasted out the rear window of the Acura and Aaron Pelletier was struck in the head as the car careened through the complex, smashing into poles before coming to a stop outside an apartment building.

After the car came to a stop, police dash-cam video showed Sean Pelletier getting out of the passenger side of the car. At that point, three separate bursts of gunfire occurred.

The MSP report said officers fired 40 round inside the apartment complex once the chase came to an end.

Of those rounds, 23 were fired by a MSP trooper while a KDPS officer fired three rounds from a 12-gauge shotgun and a sheriff's detective fired three rounds from a .40-caliber handgun.

Additionally, two other sheriff's deputies fired an unknown number of rounds. Each deputy was armed with a .223-caliber rifle.

At least two round fired by police went through the window of an apartment. One resident went into a panic attack during the shooting and police later found a broken picture frame on a living room wall and a hole on an adjacent wall.

No one other than the Pelletier brothers were injured during the incident, police have said.

MSP Detective 1st Lt. Chuck Christensen said in a report that police later found seven .223-caliber casings at the scene that were fired by one of the deputies. Four bullets fired by the other deputy's rifle struck Pelletier.

Later, police found a 7.62-caliber AK-style rifle next to the passenger door of the Acura that was loaded with a magazine and had a round chambered. Police said the gun's safety was in the off position and the gun was ready to fire.

Inside the Acura, police said investigators found a 9 mm pistol on the passenger-side floorboard, which contained a magazine and a round in the chamber. The gun also had its safety off and was ready to fire.

Additionally, police found four loaded 9 mm Luger magazines and six loaded magazines for the assault rifle in the passenger-side floorboard of the Acura. There also was an 18-inch wooden club in the car.

ZANESVILLE - A Muskingum County Sheriff's Office deputy fired one shot, killing a suspect in an apparent hostage situation Saturday night on Pinkerton Road, Sheriff Matt Lutz said.

The suspect, who has not been identified, died as a result of the gunshot wound to his chest.

The sheriff's office is not yet releasing the name of the deputy involved, as the incident remains under investigation. The deputy is on paid administrative leave.

Aside from the suspect, nobody was injured.

About an hour after deputies arrived on the scene, the suspect allegedly broke an upstairs window and pointed his gun at sheriff's deputies outside the residence in the 2800 block of Pinkerton Road. This prompted the deputy to fire one round, killing the suspect.

""The training teaches you to use the amount of force necessary to control the situation,"" Lutz said. ""I can't give you a lot of details today, but I can tell you that, in my opinion, there was an extraordinary amount of patience (Saturday) night with the officers that were on the outside of that residence and contained that situation.""

The incident began as a domestic dispute. Around 10:34 p.m., the sheriff's office received three 911 calls from female caller reporting the suspect, a man Lutz identified as the woman's boyfriend, had threatened her and her children with a gun.

Deputies arrived on the scene within 10 minutes.

The woman continued communication with law enforcement as the man allegedly held her children hostage. The sheriff's office did not release how many children were involved or their ages.

The woman and children eventually escaped the house while the man was still inside, reportedly firing rounds throughout the residence.

According to the sheriff's office, the man threatened a shootout with police while on the phone with a negotiator and continued to fire shots inside the home. The man then allegedly smashed the phone, cutting off communication with the negotiator.

The sheriff's office reported the man broke the window and pointed his gun at deputies around 11:46 p.m., after which the deputy fired his weapon.

A K-9 was sent into the residence to locate the man, followed in order by the Special Response Team and EMS. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Law enforcement secured the scene thereafter and did not leave until almost 8:30 a.m. Sunday.

""This is a very traumatic experience for everybody involved,"" Lutz said.

The incident remains under investigation by the sheriff's office and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

In addition to the sheriff's office, Special Response Team and EMS, the South Zanesville Police Department, including Chief Eric Finley, assisted.

Use of deadly force has been an uncommon occurrence for local law enforcement.

A September Times Recorder story detailed the lethal force policies of the sheriff's office, Zanesville Police Department and the state of Ohio.

Lutz said the most recent case of the sheriff's office using deadly force was after a bank robbery led to a police chase in 2007. Sgt. Pat Keck and Deputy Scott Hamilton returned fire on armed robbery suspect Pat Byrnes in February of that year. Byrnes later died of his wounds in the hospital.

The Muskingum County Sheriff's Office is releasing more details into an overnight officer-involved shooting that left one man dead.

Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz said that shortly after 10:30 p.m. Saturday, the Sheriff's Office received several 911 calls from a female reporting a domestic dispute at 2880 Pinkerton Road in South Zanesville. According to Lutz, the woman told police her live-in boyfriend was armed and threatening her and her children. As Sheriff's deputies arrived on scene, Lutz said there were other calls made between the female victim and communication's officers, where the victim told police that the male suspect had taken her kids as hostage, and was firing off rounds with a gun inside the home. Lutz said the victim and her children were able to escape the home safely.

""While our deputies were on scene, we were able to contain the boyfriend in the home, we did have deputies that had a lot of evidence of the boyfriend wanting to commit suicide, making threats,"" Lutz said. ""At one point the suspect even yelled that he was going to come to the front porch to shoot it out with law enforcement.""

Lutz said a Sheriff's Office negotiator arrived on scene and began speaking with the male suspect, who then began firing off shots inside the house and threatened to commit ""suicide by cop."" The suspect then cut off communication with the negotiator, broke an upstairs window, and pointed a gun at deputies. Lutz said one deputy fired one round, striking the suspect in the chest. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene.

""In law enforcement you're trained to use the amount of force necessary to control the situation,"" Lutz said. ""That can go from talking to somebody to reduce the risk, to going to hands-on with handcuffs to restrain somebody, to where we carry tasers, as less lethal force than a firearm, then of course to a firearm.""

Lutz said the officer involved is now on paid administrative leave. No names are being released at this time in the investigation, and no other injuries were reported in the incident. The South Zanesville Fire Department also assisted at the scene.",Yes,No,,No,,https://www.whiznews.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_small/images/story/1085802-111543.png,Yes,http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/10/27/Muskingum-County-deputy-shooting.html,"Muskingum County deputy didn’t need to kill man, girlfriend says","Muskingum County deputy didn’t need to kill man, girlfriend says

The girlfriend of the man fatally shot by a deputy sheriff during a standoff near Zanesville over the weekend acknowledged he had a history of violence, but said he didn’t deserve to die.

Sabrina Wofter’s boyfriend, Arthur Wayne West Jr., 28, was shot after the Muskingum County sheriff’s office was called around 10:30 p.m. Saturday night to Wofter’s Springfield Township home for a reported domestic dispute.

The sheriff’s office said Wofter told a dispatcher she was trying to hide because West had taken her children hostage and was firing shots.

Wofter, 38, said in an interview today she had been outside with her two children and her nephew when West came to the porch and starting firing. She told the children to run, then later learned they had gone to a neighbor’s house and were never inside the house with West, she said.When deputies arrived, West was inside pointing a gun at his head, the sheriff’s office said. A sheriff’s office negotiator later arrived and talked to West by phone, but he fired more shots, told the negotiator he was going to commit “suicide by cop” and smashed his phone.

According to the initial release from the sheriff’s office, West broke an upstairs window at 11:46 p.m. and pointed a gun at deputies. A deputy fired one shot, striking West in the chest, the sheriff’s office said.

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the shooting. The name of the deputy who fired the shot has not yet been released, but he has been placed on administrative leave, Sheriff Matt Lutz said.

West had previous convictions in Muskingum County Common Pleas Court, including criminal damaging, criminal trespassing, phone harassment and disorderly conduct, Lutz said. Zanesville Municipal Court records showed he also had multiple misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence and resisting arrest.

Wofter said West was her on-and-off boyfriend for about two and a half years and had been living with her and her children.

She acknowledged West’s violent history, but said she thought authorities could have tried other options to get him to come out of the house.

“He wasn’t the best guy and he did have a violent past,” she said. “I believe that if he would have been given the opportunity to speak to his father or brother that they possibly could’ve gotten him to come out of the house.

“I love him, and if (authorities) would have been patient, he might still be here.”

We are now wrapping up this blog – and direct you to Tom Dart’s report from Texas, which is available here.

Before this blog closes, here’s a summary of today’s events in Dallas.

A suspect who opened fire on the headquarters of Dallas police and rammed his armored van into a police cruiser was shot dead by a Swat team sniper, after he led police on a chase into the suburb of Hutchins, Texas.
Police and the suspect exchanged fire after officers cornered him in the suburb and snipers shot out his van’s engine. Police chief David Brown said the suspect eventually broke off intermittent negotiations after increasingly “agitated” and angry “rants” against police.
Bomb robots inspected the van and found two pipe bombs within. A package of pipe bombs and explosives blew up in police headquarters early Saturday morning when a bomb robot attempted to pick it up. Police also found a second explosive device, which they destroyed in a controlled detonation. 
No civilians police were injured or killed during the early morning assault in Dallas or the ensuing gunfight in Hutchins, despite dozens of rounds fired. “It was very helter-skelter for a long while,” Brown said, expressing relief and amazement that none were scathed even as buildings and cruisers were peppered with bullet holes. “This has been a very chilling moment.”
The suspect is a white male, Brown said, but he would not confirm that the suspect’s name was James Boulware, as the suspect identified himself in a 911 call to police.
Brown said the suspect “rambled” about losing custody of his child and about being named a terrorist by police. Brown said there have so far been no links to terrorism found, and that he could not confirm a motive.
Brown did not rule out any scenario but said police believed there was only one suspect. He said early witnesses likely reported multiple suspects because the one suspect opened fire from several locations and angles.
Police were investigating the last known residence of Boulware, and local media spoke to Boulware’s father, who said his son had been upset over a custody battle with family members and that he had recently purchased a van.

A cloud of dust just shot up around the suspect’s van after some kind of blast – police have not said whether it was a controlled detonation or something else.

A bomb robot quickly rolled toward the van and back in the now empty parking lot. More than five hours have gone by since police last had contact with the suspect.

At police headquarters, now a crime scene, investigators are finding bullet holes everywhere.

Police chief David Brown said that the department “barely survived” and that seeing how close so many officers came to death was “chilling”.

Dallas police attack: gunman confirmed dead hours after opening fire on HQ
 Read more
The man linked to a violent assault on Dallas police headquarters on Saturday was accused two years earlier of choking his mother, then fleeing to an east Texas town where schools were locked down out of fear he would attack them as “soft targets”, according to accounts from police and family members.

Police said the suspect, who planted pipe bombs outside headquarters and fired at officers from his armoured van, told them he was James Boulware. He was killed hours later by a police sniper. On Sunday afternoon, the medical examiner had not officially confirmed the man’s identity.

In interviews, Boulware’s father recalled his son’s seething anger at police after losing custody of his child, and his brother recalled that the family’s attempts to get Boulware help were rebuffed.

“We had tried for two years,” his brother, Andrew Boulware, said on Sunday. “I didn’t honestly think that he would ever go this far, but it was always in the back of my mind that it was a possibility.”

Authorities say it was miraculous no one else was injured in Saturday’s attack, in which the gunman sprayed the front of the building with gunfire just after midnight. After opening fire, the suspect drove the armoured van into a squad car, still firing, then led police on a chase to a restaurant parking lot in the suburb of Hutchins. The police sniper shot him during the standoff, but it took several hours to confirm his death, out of fear that he had loaded his van with more explosives.

Boulware was arrested for family violence in Dallas two years ago, in a case that was later dismissed. According to a Dallas police report, a witness said Boulware was in his mother’s house and “began talking rudely about religion, Jews and Christians”. The report said Boulware then grabbed his mother by the neck for two to three seconds, until a third person could pull him off. The two men fought until Boulware left the house.

The police report said he was then reported on the same day to be in Paris, Texas, about 100 miles away, where he grabbed weapons and body armour and talked about “shooting up schools and churches”. Andrew Boulware and his father, Jim, confirmed the incident.

Andrew Boulware accused authorities in Dallas of ignoring family members’ statements that James was mentally unstable.

“They diagnosed him as sane in 15 minutes,” he said.

Andrew Boulware remembered James claiming that he had dreamed about the December 2012 school shootings in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, and other disasters before they had happened. He also remembers pleading with his brother to get medical help, and going to a local official but being ignored.

“He never was properly diagnosed,” Andrew Boulware said. “He could be the nicest guy in the world. He tried to help friends out whenever he could. He was not a bitter person.”

His mother, Jeannine Howard, said in a statement to local media she considered her son “lost to mental health” long before his death.

“We tried to get him mental help numerous times, but the system failed him, because he was declared ‘sane’,” she said in the statement. “He was very delusional. It was very obvious.

“We hope something good can come from this, and that people will reach out to hurting souls around them and unite to build up others, rather than tearing them down. We hope that people with mental illness will receive the care they need to avoid situations like this in the future.”

Boulware lost custody of his son, something that his father, Jim, said weighed on him deeply and caused him to distrust police.

The day before the shooting, Boulware spent several hours at his father’s home in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton. He was talking about the armored van he had just purchased days earlier, having taken a bus to Georgia to pick it up and drive it back.

He also talked about the police, including his reaction to a widely watched video of a white police officer in McKinney, Texas, pushing down a black teenage girl at a pool party.

“He made statements while he was here that the police are the ones that took his son away from him,” Jim Boulware said.

But Jim Boulware said he didn’t know what was to come. His son left the house that day suggesting he was driving out to west Texas and planning to sleep in the van.

Andrew Boulware said he had not seen his brother in more than two years. He remembered James Boulware living in a home in Paris without electricity and said he tried to help him, but was rebuffed.

“I went back out there after he got released and I brought him a box of food, and he said, ‘Get off my property,’ and so I did,” Andrew Boulware said. “I tried to call him three or four times after that, but he never did answer.”",Yes,Yes,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcec7c335eea564fc950916f18eea7b8f8a2603f/0_432_1737_1039/1737.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=66469c1cd1e122adc4944fa6d7616e08,No,,NONE,No,,,,,,,,,,12:30 AM,Outdoors,Business,,Police responding to a reported offense by the victim,,"Assault,Other Crime, specify:,Homicide (attempted)",Implanted bombs,Threatening behavior (armed),,No,No,No,No,"Shoot&nbsp;<u>first</u>&nbsp;at officer,Other aggressive or non-compliant behavior.

POLICE: OFFICER SHOOTS, KILLS MAN IN SAC NEIGHBORHOOD
Sacramento shooting 
Sacramento police said an officer shot and killed a man who confronted officers with what they thought was a gun when they responded to a call of domestic violence Friday afternoon.

Police said the man wound up pointing a weapon at them, which turned out to be a BB gun.

Watch report: Officer shoots, kills man in Sacramento neighborhood

""He came out of the bedroom, he told them, 'I'm mentally ill, I'm sick, don't hurt me,"" said Sonja Morrow, who identified her boyfriend as Matthew Coates, 42.

The shooting took place Friday afternoon at the couple's home in the 2000 block of 61st Street, just south of Highway 50.

Authorities said they were responding to a call from a neighbor, who reported a disturbance at the home. But Morrow said the situation inside her home had calmed down and she and her boyfriend both fell asleep.

Norman Petersen, who lives next door to the couple, told KCRA 3 that he called police, but spoke to the couple himself before they arrived.

""(Coates) just flew up, he ordered her to get in the house, his girlfriend,"" Petersen said. ""And, he looked at me, and he says, 'You get out of here, or I'll hit you.' So, I stood my ground, I took a hit and he gave me a pretty good knock on the face.""

Petersen, who had a bruise under his left eye, said he waited more than an hour for police to arrive.

Morrow said police woke her when they arrived at her door.

A police spokesman told KCRA 3 that he did not know whether officers woke Coates. He said officers spoke to Coates in a bedroom.

Both police and Morrow said responding officers eventually left the bedroom, then asked Coates to come out. That's when, according to police, the suspect pointed the weapon at them.

""I told them, 'It's just a plastic gun, it's just a plastic gun,' and then they shot him,"" Morrow said.

Petersen said it wasn't the result he expected when he called police.

""It was over in just a few hours and this man's life was gone,"" Petersen said. ""To me it was just very sad that it couldn't have been dealt with differently. He was just a man that was struggling.""

After the shooting, Coates crawled out of his home to the walkway out front.

""And he was saying, 'Help me, help me,' Morrow said. ""He had blood coming from his mouth and his chest was bleeding bad.""

The BB gun was indistinguishable from a firearm, police said.

""Officers were absolutely forced to shoot,"" said police spokesman Doug Morse.

Morse could not say exactly how long it took officers to respond, but said when they first received the call, there was no indication of a physical fight at the home, only a verbal one.",Yes,No,,No,,NA,http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/05/16/girlfriend-man-shot-by-sacramento-police-killed-for-nothing/,Girlfriend: Man Shot By Sacramento Police ‘Killed For Nothing’,"Girlfriend: Man Shot By Sacramento Police ‘Killed For Nothing’

SACRAMENTO (CBS13) – The girlfriend of the man shot and killed by Sacramento Police is speaking out, saying she warned officers he was holding a plastic gun.

Sonja Morrow looks at pictures of her longtime boyfriend, Matt Coates. It’s only been a day since he was sleeping inside this home they shared when morrow says police suddenly showed up – hours after their fight – asking for him.

He stood at a doorway and grabbed something she says looked like this:

Replica plastic BB gun shown to us by the suspect's girlfriend. 
Replica plastic BB gun shown to us by the suspect’s girlfriend.
“I told them, ‘It’s just a plastic gun, it’s just a plastic gun.’ And they shot him,” Morrow said. “He shot him twice in the chest.”

But Sacramento Police say the gun looked real.

“The officers, in fear for their lives, fired shots at the suspect,” said Officer Traci Trapeni from the Sacramento Police Department.

Morrow says her boyfriend, bleeding, crawled his way outside the home.

The 42-year-old was taken to the hospital, where he died.

Morrow says investigators kept her for six hours at the police station.

“[They] told me they didn’t know nothing about him and they knew he was dead the whole time,” Morrow said.

Morrow admits she and her boyfriend had problems. She says Coates was bipolar, money was tough, and he had hit her in the past.

“We had some issues, but we loved each other,” Morrow said.

Now she is only comforted by her son and memories of the man she loved.

Someone left a sign that reads “Matt’s life had value. Pause,” on her car – a message Morrow believes is important to remember.

Sacramento police say they later determined the suspect’s gun to be a black, semi-automatic BB gun which they say looks just like a real handgun.

A man died Tuesday morning after being shot by a police officer in Jourdanton.
Police in Jourdanton fatally shot a man who is alleged to have charged at them Tuesday morning with a pipe in one hand and a knife in the other.
The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office identified the man as Richard B. McClendon, 43, of Jourdanton, a small town about 40 miles south of downtown San Antonio.
Jourdanton Police Department Chief Eric Kaiser said officers responded to a home in the 600 block of Olive Street around 11:30 a.m. for a report of McClendon destroying the interior of his mother's house.
Kaiser said police had dealt with McClendon in the past and that he was known to have ""mental health issues.""
When officers arrived, McClendon had locked himself inside a bathroom, they reported. He charged at the officers with the weapons after they urged him to come out, Kaiser said.
One officer fired a Taser, but it had no effect, he said. As the man continued to charge, a second officer fired one round, striking the man in the torso, according to authorities.
Kaiser said the officer who fired the fatal round has been on the force in Jourdanton for about seven years and has spent a total of 11 years as a law enforcement officer.
Authorities are still investigating the scene.

A man who was shot by a Chicago Police officer early Saturday in the South Shore neighborhood died Thursday night.

Alfontish Cockerham, 23, was pronounced dead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital at 10:57 p.m., according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

An autopsy Friday found that Cockerham died of complications of multiple gunshot wounds, and ruled his death a homicide, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

Cockerham, of the 11800 block of South Harvard, had been charged before his death with one count of aggravated assault of a peace officer with a weapon, and one count of unlawful use of a weapon, both felonies, according to Chicago Police.

About 12:10 a.m. Saturday, officers were called to the 7000 block of South Merrill for a report of a person with a gun, Assistant State’s Attorney Erin Antoniette said in bond court Wednesday. Cockerham did not appear for the hearing because he remained hospitalized.

An officer pulled up and saw Cockerham and two others walking at 71st and Merrill, Antoniette said. When the officer got out of the car and announced he was police, Cockerham ran eastbound on 71st as the other two put their hands up.

As Cockerham was running, he saw two other officers, turned around and ran westbound, Antoniette said. He came toward the first officer who had stopped him, and the officer saw a gun in his right hand.

Cockerham ran past the officer northbound on Merrill, then pointed the gun at the officer, Antoniette said. The officer fired, striking him at least once, authorities said.

A .45 caliber gun was recovered at the scene, Antoniette said.

Judge Laura Sullivan set bond at $100,000 for Cockerham, who had previous convictions for trying to disarm a police officer, and aggravated battery to an officer.

Desiree Carter, 30, who lives in South Shore and identified herself as a cousin, said she doesn’t believe the police narrative.

“He didn’t have no gun,” she said. “The police around here see him every day, they know him, that’s a lie… All he keeps on him is his headphones.”

Carter was one of about a dozen people gathered at the scene early Saturday.

Kesha Williams, 32, said she watched the shooting from her apartment window, where she was sitting while waiting for the father of her children.

“He didn’t do nothing,” Williams said, calling the man “Nunu” and adding she knows him from the neighborhood.

She said “Nunu” was shot six times. Once he was on the ground, Williams said an officer put him in handcuffs, then kicked him.

“He didn’t mess with nobody,” Williams said, adding she didn’t see a gun in his hand.

“He rapped. He liked to walk up and down the street and rap,” she said.",No,,,,,,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-alfontish-cockerham-shot-by-police-20150626-story.html,Man shot by police over weekend dies Thursday night,"Man shot by police over weekend dies Thursday night

Man dies 5 days after being shot by police on South Side
A 23-year-old man shot by police Saturday died Thursday night at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.

Alfontish Cockerham had remained hospitalized since police shot him in the 7000 block of South Merrill Avenue on Saturday after police said he turned toward them and raised a gun.

Cockerham, of the 11800 block of South Harvard Avenue, was charged with assault after the shooting but remained hospitalized with gunshot wounds and didn't make a court appearance.

A judge set bail at $100,000 on Wednesday while Cockerham remained hospitalized.

The shooting happened after several Area Central Gun Team units responded to a call about men with guns at around 12:10 a.m. Saturday in the 7000 block of South Merrill Avenue, according to police.

When officers arrived, four people were standing on a corner on the north side of 71st Street and Merrill Avenue, police said. Cockerham, one of the four people there, took off running east but then came back after he saw an officer approaching from that direction.

One of the officers saw that Cockerham had a gun and told him to drop it. Cockerham then turned, raised the gun at the officer and the officer shot at him several times, police said.

Joseph Paffen was armed 'sovereign citizen' killed by deputies, investigators say

The same day a judge granted a domestic-violence injunction that was meant to keep Joseph Paffen away from his ex-girlfriend, he violated it, court documents say.

As the woman was leaving the Orange County Courthouse with the injunction on Jan. 30, Paffen followed her to her car.

The woman's friend stood between her and Paffen to stop him from grabbing her as he told her that he had been in love with her for three months.

Nine days after that confrontation, Paffen was killed by Orange County deputies in the Conway Crossing shopping plaza on Hoffner Road.

Deputies say Paffen was at the plaza because he wanted to meet his ex-girlfriend there.

The woman called deputies to report that he had contacted her again in violation of the injunction.

 Pictures: Crimes that shocked Florida
From mass slayings to strange attacks, these are pictures of the most bizarre and shocking crimes to happen in Florida.
Court records and Paffen's Facebook page paint a picture of Paffen's final weeks.

""I feel as thought I've been dragged to hell with the loss of all I love,"" Paffen wrote the day before he was killed. ""But I'd crawl back! I'd never fail to stand by my loved ones, and fix the mistakes I've made.

Paffen's ex-girlfriend requested the injunction after she said Paffen sent her endless text messages, attacked her and beat her husband with a bat.

It wasn't clear how long she had been married.

""Joseph Paffen broke my husband's jaw and arm with a baseball bat,"" the woman wrote. ""I am scared for my life and my husband's life... Joseph Paffen is aggressive and very violent as he is also very angry with the government. He also has stock piles of guns, ammunition, food, water, medications and first aid items.""

Paffen, who deputies say identified himself as a ""sovereign citizen,"" was not charged for any of the accusations made against him in the injunction, though an investigation was underway.

Paffen has been arrested several times in the past, records show.

His arrest record dates back to a burglary and grand larceny arrest in 1990 but in the past 15 years, his arrests have been largely non-violent.

Most of his encounters with law enforcement started with traffic violations.

He was arrested in 2007 on charges of counterfeiting a license plate and driving without a valid license or vehicle registration.

Typically, self-described sovereign citizens claim that they don't have to follow federal, state or city laws, including tax regulations.

Two deputies were injured in Sunday's gun battle but are expected to recover.

Five officers were placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.

Sheriff's deputies in Florida shot and killed a man described as having anti-government views Sunday, after the suspect allegedly opened fire on a sport utility vehicle full of law-enforcement officers, the sheriff's office said.

The Orange County Sheriff's Office on Tuesday identified the gunman as Joseph Paffen, 46.

Paffen allegedly opened fire on a vehicle with four deputies inside as they responded to a call for a domestic incident involving Paffen at a Publix grocery store in Orlando at 5:18 p.m. Sunday, and the officers returned fire, killing him, the sheriff's office said. One deputy was shot in the leg and another was hurt by flying glass as bullets crashed into the SUV.

Deputies told NBC station WESH that Paffen identified as a ""sovereign citizen."" ""It means that in many regards, they do not recognize the existing government,"" Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings told the station. Before the incident that drew the deputies to the supermarket, the sheriff's office said Paffen left voice mails on the phone of a woman who had taken out a restraining order against him, and she called the authorities after Paffen asked her to meet him in the Publix parking lot, the station reported.

DETROIT, MI -- Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy late Tuesday cleared the St. Clair Shores police officer who turned in front of and caused the death of 20-year-old motorcyclist James Bush July 22.

While dash-cam footage taken just prior to the collision shows the motorcycle's headlights apparently working properly, Worthy's office determined the motorcycle wasn't visible to the officer.



Watch dash-cam footage of broadcast by WDIV-TV Channel 4 News in September

""The police car video of the accident supports the police officer and the witnesses' statements regarding the lack of visibility of the motorcycle,"" said the release issued by Worthy's office about 4:50 p.m. Tuesday.

Investigators say a minivan passed the patrol officer with its lights off about 9:30 p.m. while westbound on Eight Mile in Harper Woods. The eastbound officer made a U-turn and began pursuing the driver. It appears the driver of the minivan switched their headlights on prior to the officer initiating the traffic stop.

The minivan, whose operator told police she had a suspended license and and became fearful when she saw the officer behind her, turned into a driveway on the south side of Eight Mile. The police officer made the same turn immediately in front of Bush's motorcycle about three seconds later.

It's not clear from the dash-cam video if the police officer engaged his siren or flashing lights prior to making the turn, but Worthy's office said: ""The lights on the police vehicle activated almost simultaneously with the accident ... ""

Bush, a 2013 Lake Shore High School graduate, was driving to his mother's home for dinner after having left his job.

James Bush obituary
State police performed that crash investigation and turned their findings over to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office sometime prior to Sept. 11.

Worthy's office said the minivan driver, her passenger, the driver of a vehicle that separated the minivan and police vehicle and the police officer all said they didn't see Bush's motorcycle.

Although it doesn't appear to have played a role in the crash, Worthy's office noted in its statement that, according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office, Bush was ""technically"" under the influence, because ""negligible"" amounts of THC were found in his blood.

The Prosecutor noted the police officer's clear driving history, ""including no on-duty traffic accidents in his 14 years"" on the job; and said Bush had two speeding tickets and an accident in 2013.

The officer was placed on paid administrative leave following the crash. MLive couldn't immediately verify his current work status Tuesday night.

MLive attempted unsuccessfully to reach Bush's mother, father and grandfather for reaction to Worthy's decision.

""The evidence shows that the officer did in fact yield and made a reasonable determination that he could safely turn left,"" the Prosecutor's Office concluded."" It is a tragic fact that the officer simply could not see the motorcycle due to the lighting conditions at dusk, and the fact that the motorcycle's headlight blended with the headlights of the vehicle behind it.

The motorcyclist killed in a crash with a St. Clair Shores police car late Wednesday was a 20-year-old man who resided in the city, police said Thursday.

“This was a tragic accident and was not the result of a police pursuit,” Police Chief Todd Woodcox said in a press release. “Our city grieves for the family and their tragic loss of a loved one.”

Officials have not yet divulged the man’s name. He was riding a motorcycle that collided with a police car driven by an officer who was making a U-turn on Eight Mile Road, between Interstate 94 and Beaconsfield Road, at approximately 9:30 p.m. to perform a traffic stop.

The motorcyclist was transported to a hospital where doctors declared him dead at 10:11 p.m.

St. Clair Shores police contacted the Michigan State Police to handle the investigation. Such requests are not unusual and are made to avoid any potential hint of impropriety.

“We cannot undo the tragedy, but we can promise a full and complete investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash,” Woodcox said. “Michigan State Police are investigating the crash. It would be inappropriate for our department to comment further on the investigation of another police department.”

Information about the officer involved in the crash was not released.

Eight Mile was closed after the crash and reopened to traffic after 1 a.m., State Police Lt. Calvin Hart said.

Hart said the State Police Special Investigative Section is handling the investigation. He declined to comment on any findings thus far.

Woodcox was not available for additional comment Thursday.

Police have not revealed the name of the patrol officer involved in the incident but the officer has been placed on administrative leave as the investigation continues, St. Clair Shores police Lt. Anthony Pietrzak said.

Officials from two police agencies await prosecutors’ decision whether criminal charges will be filed following a fatal traffic crash involving an on-duty St. Clair Shores officer.

The officer, whose name has not been divulged publicly, made a U-turn at approximately 9:30 p.m. July 22 on Eight Mile Road, between Interstate 94 and Beaconsfield Road, to pull over a motorist, police said at the time.

James Bush, 20, was riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle and collided with the police vehicle.

Bush, who resided in the city and was a captain of the 2012-13 Lake Shore High School football team, was transported to a hospital. Approximately 45 minutes later, doctors declared him dead.

St. Clair Shores police officials contacted the Michigan State Police to conduct the investigation.

The resulting findings by the State Police Special Investigation Section were turned over to the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office about three or four weeks ago, State Police Lt. Michael Shaw said Wednesday.

“We let them decide which –- if any –- criminal charges will be filed,” Shaw told The Macomb Daily. He declined to release other details of the incident beyond the extent of the preliminary information provided by St. Clair Shores police to the media on the night of the crash.

Among the information not yet revealed: the directions the officer and Bush were heading seconds before the patrolman’s U-turn.

The results of the investigation were submitted to the Wayne County Prosecutor because the collision occurred on the Harper Woods side of Eight Mile Road.

The St. Clair Shores officer remains on paid administrative leave, Deputy Chief Steve Lambert said Thursday. Such leave is a common procedure whenever a police officer is involved in an incident that results in death or the use of lethal force.

As a courtesy, Michigan State Police provided to St. Clair Shores police officials a copy of the formal crash report plus additional information submitted to prosecutors, Lambert said.

The deputy chief said city police will not disclose details until prosecutors reach a conclusion and notify both agencies.

“They know this officer is off on administrative leave. He and our department are anxious for some sort of answer from them. They promised us they would move on it as quickly as possible,” Lambert added.

The findings delivered to prosecutors were expected to include the autopsy report of Bush and results of toxicology tests to the Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office.

Whatever the outcome in the government setting, the city’s police force feels the incident remains tragic for everyone involved, Lambert said.

“They’re supporting their fellow member knowing what it all entails. Obviously the police department has to move on, day in and day out. There are calls that have to be answered. We can’t dwell for too long on what happened,” said the deputy chief, noting that officers continue to sympathize for Bush’s family and feel their grief.

ST CLAIR SHORES. Mich. - A lawsuit has been filed by a family whose son died in a motorcycle crash with a police car.

The crash happened on Old Eight Mile Road when the St. Clair Shores officer collided with the motorcycle last July. The driver, James Bush, died from his injuries.

His family says they want accountability for what happened part of the reason they've filed a lawsuit.

On a dash cam from the St. Clair Shores police officer's car, a van without headlights passes. The police car makes a u-turn to pursue it, the officer turns into the path of Bush.

At the request of the family, FOX 2 will not show the impact.

""It's clear from the video that there is less than a one second timeframe for my client to take evasive action,"" said attorney David Femminineo. ""It's a complete disregard for everyone's safety on the road.""

After the accident the police officer calls for an ambulance then goes out to check on Bush. He was taken to the hospital where he later died.

Now, months later, the family of Bush has hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit against the officer involved in the crash, alleging he acted negligantly and wrecklessly by turning into the path of oncoming traffic. 

""A police officer clearly has a duty to not only citizens to uphold the laws, but to do so in a safe manner,"" Femminineo said.

Michigan State Police investigated the crash and has turned over the findings to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office. A spokesperson said it is still an active investigation.

The lawsuit was filed Monday, however the city attorney says they have not seen the lawsuit and couldn't comment.

Police tape blocks the 200 block of Century Street in Jacksonville after a police shooting that left a person dead inside a residence about 2 p.m. Oct. 28. No officers were injured.
Police shot and killed a suspect Wednesday while trying to serve a warrant at a Century Street home off Atlantic Boulevard.

It happened about 2 p.m. in the 200 block for a high-risk search warrant, Undersheriff Pat Ivey said. The subject had previous armed encounters with police.

The door opened and the officers saw someone with a handgun, Ivey said. That person turned toward the officers with the gun in one of his hands, prompting Officer Nick Rodgers to shoot him once with his rifle. The unidentified suspect died.

Children were in a back room of the home at the time, Ivey said. Multiple firearms and cocaine also were seized in the home.

Rodgers was involved in two other police shootings with no fatalities in 2007 and 2014. In the first one Rodgers was shot in the mouth while chasing a suspect. He was able to fire back wounding the suspect in a leg.

Wenesday around the same time, the Sheriff's Office also sent out a similar ""police-activity"" alert in the 1900 block of Jammes Road. The Sheriff's Office confirmed it was a shooting, but did not involve police.

JFRD is responding to a house fire that it says is fully engulfed in flames on Prince Edward Road. News4Jax has a crew on the way.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Police continue their investigation into the man who was shot and killed Wednesday afternoon by a SWAT officer who was on a team serving a narcotics search warrant at an Arlington home, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

The Sheriff's Office called it a high-risk warrant because the suspect is known to have used firearms before, and officers said they found multiple drugs, guns and children inside the house after they shot and killed the suspect.

The fatal shot was fired from a doorway into the home in the 200 block of Century Street. Officers later found two children in another room in the house, Undersheriff Pat Ivey said.

Nick Rodgers, a 12-year veteran of JSO, fired his .223 caliber assault rifle at the man, whose name has not been released, because the man was wielding a handgun and turned toward the SWAT officers who were entering the home, Ivey said. The man died at the scene.

Ivey said the search warrant was being served by a SWAT team because the subject of the warrant, who was accused of dealing cocaine, was known to have been armed before. Ivey said the man shot is believed to be the subject of the search warrant, but his identity has not been confirmed.

One other man and two women were also inside the home, along with the children, Ivey said. No one else was injured.

""They do a briefing before every execution of warrant, which includes being mindful of animals, children, other people, pedestrian traffic, vehicular traffic, the structure itself, all of those things,"" Ivey said. ""Always be mindful of what we call the backstop -- what is behind the subject you are discharging your firearm at.""

Cocaine and other firearms besides the handgun the man was wielding were found in plain sight in the home, which is in the Woodland Acres area off Atlantic Boulevard. No arrests have been made.

As police continue to work the case family members of the man who was shot said they feel that police are unfairly targeting their neighborhood. 

""It's pretty peaceful, believe it or not. Cops mess people on a daily basis around here because they say it's a known drug neighborhood. But there's 100 million more drug neighborhoods but they're always messing with this one,"" resident Brandy Rayburn said. 

Per JSO protocol, Rodgers has been placed on administrative leave pending a review of the shooting, Ivey said.

Rodgers was also involved in a shooting in 2007. He was shot in the face during an exchange of gunfire with a drug suspect after officers responded to a call of a suspicious person at 24th and Haines Streets on the Eastside, where anti-drug surveillance was taking place. Rodgers needed jaw surgery and lost some teeth. He was awarded a Purple Heart for that incident.

Streets around the home where Wednesday's shooting happened will be blocked off through the evening, but residents in the area will be escorted back to their homes by officers, as needed, a JSO spokesman said.

""The police are always doing something in this neighborhood -- always,"" neighbor Mary Lewis-Chacon said. ""Things are going to happen, but every day it's something in this neighborhood.""

""I was the narcotics commander for four years,"" Ivey said. ""Many people in this community called us to address the narcotics and prostitution activity in this area -- very specific to this immediate area.""

This is the ninth police-involved shooting this year involving the JSO. Four of the previous eight shootings involved a fatality.

Ivey said he plans to release more details, including the victim's name, in an update Thursday. News4Jax will stream that briefing live. A time for the briefing has not been announced yet.

TUSCOLA — The Douglas County state's attorney has determined there was nothing criminal in the actions of two police officers who shot and killed a man in Arcola two months ago.

Kevin Nolan said Thursday that he finished reviewing reports and recordings compiled by Illinois State Police investigators involving the Jan. 11 shooting death of Tommy E. Smith, 39, of Arcola, on Wednesday. He received the information last Friday.

""I looked through about an inch of paper and a big envelope of CDs of recordings of interviews, autopsy, scene photos, police camera recordings, in-car camera recordings. I read everything and I looked at the scene photos and the in-car enhanced video and listened to the 911 radio traffic. Everything is consistent from the interviews and the recordings,"" Nolan said.

""There is a colloquialism known as suicide by cop,"" said the prosecutor.

Nolan said he would not be filing any charges against Tuscola police officer Mark Payne or part-time Arcola police officer Sean Junge.

County Coroner Joe Victor said he will conduct an inquest into the manner of Mr. Smith's death at 7 p.m. March 18 at the Douglas County Courthouse. He intends to call as witnesses two state police investigators and two witnesses to the shooting. An autopsy confirmed Mr. Smith died from multiple gunshot wounds to his chest and neck.

Nolan said the shooting happened at 224 Circle Drive, Arcola, the home of Norma Jean Tomlin, Mr. Smith's mother, about 6:45 p.m. on that Sunday.

Police had been called there at 5:39 p.m. by Mr. Smith's stepbrother, David Wilson, who lived down the street.

""The stepbrother called 911 indicating a domestic situation between Tommy and their mom and that Tommy had been to the stepbrother's house wanting a key to mom's house,"" said Nolan.

Nolan said while in the presence of Wilson, Mr. Smith pulled out a handgun and put a bullet in the chamber. He wasn't threatening Wilson with it, Nolan said.

Wilson told Mr. Smith that he should calm down and that he was going to call the police. Mr. Smith then went to his mother's house.

Nolan said several police officers set up a perimeter around Tomlin's home.

""Officer Mark Payne from Tuscola is across the street so he can see into the house, the front window,"" Nolan said. The curtains were pulled back and the main door to the house was open so Payne was looking through a storm door.

Mr. Smith also had an AR-15 rifle, Nolan said.

""A couple other officers were behind a tree two doors to the west. Mr. Smith occasionally sticks his head out the door screaming and swearing at officers as they try to talk to him. At one point, he agrees to put the rifle down. He's been coming out with the rifle strapped to him but not raised and pointed.

""There's back and forth. Eventually, he says 'I'm going to put it away.' Two Arcola officers put their rifles down and go in and talk to him for a little bit,"" said Nolan.

Inside the house, the officers observed he had been drinking.

""He's drinking beer, lots of it, and watching the football game. They didn't find out much but decided to pull back and a while later, he comes out. He's agitated because he sees the officers still out there.

""There's more yelling and he raises the rifle, does something with it, and he aims it toward where the officers are behind the tree next door. When he raised the rifle, he was heard to say, '(expletive) it.' A couple shots (by officers) and he's down and he dies right there,"" said the prosecutor.

The shots by police came from Junge who was behind the tree to the west and Payne who was across the street, Nolan said.

Nolan said Mr. Smith was the only one in the house during the hour that police had surrounded it. His mother and stepfather had gotten out before police arrived, he said.

ARCOLA — The stepmother of an Arcola man who died over the weekend in an officer-involved shooting has offered her family's side of the story.

According to an autopsy, Tommy E. Smith, 39, of Arcola, died from gunshot wounds to the right chest and to the left neck at his home at 224 Circle Drive, on the north side of town.

Illinois State Police Lt. Greg Lindemulder said the incident began at 5:39 p.m. Sunday, when Arcola police were sent to the home to respond to a 911 call about a domestic disturbance. The call indicated that there was somebody at the home with a handgun.

When police arrived at the home, they said they were confronted by Mr. Smith, who was armed with both an assault rifle and a handgun. Mr. Smith was then shot and killed.

Laura Smith of Oakland, stepmother of Tommy Smith, offered more details about the incident to The News-Gazette on Thursday:

""Here's the story. Tom was intoxicated. He was drunker than a skunk, and he did have a firearm.

""The original reason the police were called was for a domestic violence call. Tom was living with his mother and stepfather, and they got into an argument. Tom threatened a family member with the gun.

""The mother and stepfather got up and left the house and called Tom's brother, David Wilson, who lived across the street.

""The Arcola police got there first. Tom had lived at that address for years, so the police knew him.

""The police went to the door and told Tom, 'We heard, Tom, you got a gun. Well, you need to put that gun in another room, buddy. We want to talk to you.'

""So Tom put away the gun and let the two Arcola police officers into the home. They went in and talked to Tom.

""You need to understand that Tom does have a history of mental illness and he did have a FOID card. One of the things being investigated is how somebody with a history of mental illness could be issued an FOID card.

""After the police officers talked to Tom for about 10 to 15 minutes, the police officers came out of the house and went out to the yard to stand outside a tree. They joined three other police officers out there.

""Within a matter of minutes, Tom had come to the door and even let his cat into the house. He was pretty sure that everything was cool.

""But when he opened the door, Tom saw the street lined with police officers from Arcola, Arthur, Tuscola and the Douglas County sheriff's office.

""Tom then stepped outside, and his brother heard him say, 'You (expletive) liars! You told me you were leaving!'

""He went back into the house, and he picked up his AR-15 assault rifle and his pistol. Remember, he was still drunk.

""Tom then walked about outside, and his brother heard him say, 'If this is the way you want it, bring it on.'

""Then 21 shots were fired by the police. He was riddled like he was John Dillinger. I don't know how many times Tom was hit, but it was several times in the neck and chest.

""The undertaker told the family he had a lot of work to do.""

WOODBRIDGE — The Woodbridge man believed to have stabbed a woman to death and critically injured another victim earlier in Old Bridge has died from wounds he received when he was shot by police after he barricaded himself in his home Monday.

Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew Carey announced Tuesday morning that Rodney Jencsik, 50, a resident of the trailer-home park on Freddie Avenue in Avenel, was shot at about 7:30 p.m. Monday. He was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, where he was pronounced dead at 8:30 p.m.

Carey said Monday night that police shot Jencsik twice.

The prosecutor said the shooting ended a stand-off that began at the man's home at about 4 p.m., an hour after he apparently stabbed Dina Marie Heil, 46, of Parlin and a man, whose name is being withheld, at a home on Englishtown Road in Old Bridge.

Sources say the attacks occurred as a result of a love triangle. Jencsik had been dating Heil, the sources said and suspected she was seeing someone else. Neither the woman nor Jencsik lived at the Englishtown home.

Heil was taken to Old Bridge Regional Hospital where she was pronounced dead at 4:35 p.m. and the man was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital where he is being treated.

Carey said Old Bridge police received the call about the stabbings at 2:35 p.m. and posted an alert for Jencsik, who was later seen in Woodbridge driving a Jaguar.

Woodbridge police attempted to stop him, but he fled, Carey said.

Police followed him to the Freddie Avenue home where members of the Woodbridge police and later the department's special operations team surrounded the house and attempted to convince the man to surrender, the prosecutor said.

Carey said when Jencsik eventually emerged in the doorway of the house, he was brandishing what appeared to be a gun and was shot by police.

The prosecutor did not disc lose any further information about the gun.

An investigation of the shooting is being conducted by the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. The state Attorney General's Office has been notified of the shooting in accordance with the use of force guidelines.

Carey said the investigation into the details surrounding the stabbings is active and continuing.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office at (732) 745-3300.

WOODBRIDGE - Police were justified in fatally shooting a township man in October, Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey announced on Friday.

Rodney Jencsik, 49, was killed on Oct. 5 during a lengthy standoff at his Freddie Avenue residence in the Avenel section.

The report released by Carey said that the police's use of deadly force was justifiable because Jencsik ignored commands to drop his handgun that he was brandishing at officers.

Jencsik had also shown that he had a ""willingness"" to cause serious bodily injury in a stabbing earlier that day in Old Bridge.

During the standoff, Jencsik was heard threatening the officers multiple times.

READ: Man shot dead by police in Woodbridge standoff

READ: Multiple weapons found in home of barricaded Woodbridge man

The report concludes that the officers, who have not been identified, had a ""reasonable belief"" that they were in jeopardy.

The incident began with the Old Bridge Police Department and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office investigating the stabbing of two people in Old Bridge. 

One of the stabbing victims, 46-year-old Dina Marie Heil, of Parlin, died of her wounds the same day.

Police were able to identify Jencsik as the suspect, and a description of his vehicle was broadcast to surrounding towns as he fled the scene.

Woodbridge police spotted the vehicle and tried to stop it, but Jencsik fled, disregarding traffic laws and refusing to stop.

The pursuit ended when Jencsik stopped in front of his Freddie Avenue house and, covered with blood and holding a handgun, barricaded himself inside.


In an attempt to make him surrender, Woodbridge police officers immediately brought in its crisis negotiation team to talk Jencsik out of his house, but the negotiations were futile because he seemed ""extremely intoxicated and conversations lacked any meaningful dialogue,"" according to the prosecutor's office. Eventually, the contact was lost and subsequent calls went to voicemail.

A chemical agent known as ""CS,"" which irritates the skin and respiratory system, was then thrown into his house in hopes he would come out and surrender. Instead, Jencsik kicked open the door holding a gun and said, ""I will kill you!""

The officers ordered Jencsik to drop the weapon and began throwing additional canisters of the chemical agent into the house. Jencsik then allegedly said, “Come in here and I will kill you” and “Don’t make me do it.""

Officers gave multiple commands to drop the gun, according to the prosecutor's office's statement, but Jencsik took aim at police. A police officer fired less-lethal bullets at Jencsik, but he was still standing, so another officer unloaded two rounds into his chest.

The officers provided medical treatment, but Jencsik was pronounced dead at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. A sawed-off shotgun and a handgun were found inside his house.

To comply with the state Attorney General's use-of-force guidelines, the officer who shot Jencsik had his training record ""reviewed and it was determined that he has received and successfully completed all annual mandatory firearms and Use of Force training prior to this incident,"" according to the prosecutor's office.

A man suspected of assault was shot on a north Minneapolis street by a police officer early Sunday while allegedly hindering emergency responders from aiding his victim.

The shooting ignited a chaotic scene of shouting and taunting bystanders who believed the man was handcuffed before police opened fire.

Police Chief Janeé Harteau said Sunday afternoon that her department’s preliminary information is that the man was not handcuffed when police shot him.

Police did not identify the man, but Nekima Levy-Pounds, president of the Minneapolis NAACP, said in a statement that he was Jamar Clark, a black man in his mid-20s, and that he had been “shot and killed” by police.

The debate on the public stage is showing no signs of easing. The Minneapolis chapter of Black Lives Matter has scheduled a news conference for 9 a.m. Monday outside the Police Department precinct headquarters on the North Side. The chapter is calling for the release of any video police might have of the shooting as well as disclosure of the names of the officers involved.

Clark’s relatives, including several sisters, gathered in a room on the seventh floor intensive-care unit at Hennepin County Medical Center Sunday afternoon where a physician told them that Clark is brain dead, according to one family member. Clark was shot “in the head, execution style,” a family member said.

Police chief Janeé Harteau spoke to media about the early morning shooting on the 1600 block of Plymouth Ave. N.

A hospital chaplain and a member of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension visited the family in a consultation room where they spent most of Sunday afternoon awaiting news about Clark.

Ambulance was called

The confrontation began about 12:45 a.m. in the 1600 block of Plymouth Avenue N., according to police. Authorities have yet to reveal the identities of the people involved or elaborate on the exact circumstances leading up to the assault.

Nekelia Sharp, who lives across the street, said an ambulance was called after the suspect and his girlfriend got into an argument. While paramedics were taking the girlfriend away, the suspect tried to talk to her. Sharp said that’s when he was handcuffed and then shot.

Bystanders swarmed as emergency vehicles were responding. In a video posted on Facebook by a witness, one woman was repeatedly shouting, “Y’all just killed that man!” Others nearby were pointing at police and taunting them.

A few seconds of the video showed an emergency responder kneeling over someone on the ground.

Witnesses said that officers pushed the increasingly agitated crowd back toward the Elks Lodge across the street and that several people were pepper-sprayed.

“We’ve been saying for a long time that Minneapolis was one bullet away from Ferguson. Well, that bullet was fired last night,” said Jason Sole, an associate professor at Metropolitan State University and a member of the local NAACP chapter.

The NAACP statement quoted witness Teto Wilson, who said Clark “was just laying there. He was not resisting arrest. Two officers were surrounding the victim on the ground, an officer maneuvered his body around to shield Jamar’s body, and I heard the shot go off.”

According to police scanner audio of the incident, posted on the MN Police Clips Facebook page, the apparent domestic confrontation started in an apartment. An officer is later heard requesting all available squad cars, saying, “We’ve got a big crowd; we need a lot of cops.”

At City Hall

The incident has been turned over to the state BCA for investigation, said Harteau, who added that two officers were placed on standard administrative leave.

“Please contact the BCA,” the chief said during a midday City Hall news conference with Mayor Betsy Hodges and BCA Superintendent Drew Evans at her side. “We need to know the truth.”

She also cautioned everyone that “there is a lot of speculation out there” about how the incident unfolded.

Evans said there were “handcuffs at the scene,” but that the preliminary information is that the man was not cuffed. Looking into that aspect of the case “is part of the active investigation,” Evans said. “These investigations take time, and we want to make sure we are thorough.”

Officers answered a call about an assault and were then alerted that the suspect “had returned to the area and was confronting paramedics and disrupting their ability to render aid,” a statement from police read.

As officers were attempting to calm the suspect, an altercation erupted with the man, “who was not in handcuffs,” the statement continued.

“At some point during the struggle, an officer discharged his weapon, striking the suspect,” the statement read.

Anger, lack of trust

Anger and distrust fueled a rally called by Black Lives Matter Minneapolis that began at 3 p.m. at the shooting scene and continued into the evening a few blocks away outside the police department’s Fourth Precinct headquarters.

The protest began with about 250 people ringing the block where Clark was shot, to create a “no-cops zone.” Its leaders refused to participate in a community listening session called by Hodges at the Minneapolis Urban League, also on Plymouth Avenue N.

Rally speakers held firm to the view that Clark was handcuffed when shot and voiced doubt that a BCA probe could be impartial.

Inside the Urban League, Hodges and Harteau stepped back after introductory comments about the call for independent review, as the gathering gave way to shouts between community members in the room.

The meeting fell apart a short time later after people were drowned out by yells of “Justice for who? Jamar!”

 Demonstrators chanted at Minneapolis Police Officers at the side entrance to the 4th Precinct station on Morgan Ave. N. Sunday night in Minneapolis.

Hodges managed to squeeze in a short reply to a question about whether a BCA investigation could be trusted, saying that the agency had been “looking at these kinds of cases for a long time.”

Later, a smaller crowd continued to demonstrate outside the Fourth Precinct station, where a Black Lives Matter banner was hung and food and blankets were brought in.

Mica Grimm, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, was among about 10 college students and activists occupying an entryway at the station.

She said people plan to stay there — taking turns for weeks, if necessary — until the officer responsible for the shooting is arrested or indicted.

“We’re here because police officers have gotten away with murder for so long and we’re tired of it,” Grimm said.

Protesters and city and police officials agreed on one thing: Anyone who witnessed or has a cellphone video of the shooting should step forward. Witnesses are urged to call the BCA at 651-793-7000, the mayor told the Urban League crowd.",Yes,No,,No,,"NA ,

 Save for later
Police detained 51 people after a night of protests in Minneapolis over the shooting of Jamar Clark during an arrest.

Police have said Clark was shot following a struggle when they tried to arrest him, but family members insist he was shot “execution-style” and witnesses have said he was already in handcuffs.

On Monday the Minneapolis mayor, Betsy Hodges, asked for help from the Department of Justice in investigating Clark’s death, and Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison wrote to attorney general Loretta Lynch formally requesting an investigation.

This failed to fully satisfy activists, community leaders and protesters, who took to the streets on Monday for the second night in a row. They assembled outside the Minneapolis police fourth precinct building – less than 100 metres from the small makeshift shrine which marks the spot where Clark was shot and gravely wounded – and demanded the release of video footage from the shooting.

Protesters closed the road, put up tents outside the precinct including a makeshift canteen, and built a fire pit. Outside in the street activists chanted “Handcuffs, don’t shoot!” - a variation on the “Hands up, don’t shoot” refrain of the Black Lives Matter movement since the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

One man, particularly agitated, swore and yelled: “This man was murdered.” There were children present and several people chastised him for cursing in front of them. He continued to shout; around him, people formed a circle and chanted the Lord’s Prayer. In the center of the circle, the man still jumped and shouted. Over their words, his voice, hoarse with screaming, could be heard. “Tell God to bring Jamar back,” he yelled. After a while a friend arrived to calm him down.

From the precinct building at around 6.45pm, a larger group of around 300 protesters marched to interstate 94, where they blockaded the freeway for several hours. One of them, 36-year-old Airy Collins, from Minneapolis, told the Guardian that Clark’s shooting “seemed like another blatant smack in the face to me and I knew it was time to act immediately … it didn’t take a moment for me to jump off my couch.”

Collins, like many others there, was returning for a second day of protest. “[We’re] feeling united, people are united,” she said. “And we’re tired. We’re sick and tired of the same old politics as usual, and now we have to start bringing it to the streets, because people are fed up.” She echoed the protesters’ demand for the video to be released. As she spoke, others – including several children – were dancing on the freeway in the flashing lights of police cars.

The road was blocked for several hours. Police began routing cars down the bank to get them out of the gridlock; one car got stuck.

By 9pm the protest on I-94 was reduced to a core of roughly 50 people, linking arms across the road. From the embankment on the side many more watched and chanted encouragement. Police, approaching from both directions along the carriageway, slowly closed in on them. A few escaped by running down the embankment but most of the rest were arrested.

After receiving four dispersal warnings, 43 adults and eight juveniles were arrested, according to Tiffani Schweigart, the public information officer for the Minnesota State police. All of the arrests were made on I-94 and were without violent incident, Schweigart said.

Both the adults and the juveniles were to be charged with unlawful assembly, and being a pedestrian on the freeway – a misdemeanor offence in Minnesota. They would all be released the same night when they posted bail, Schweigart said.

Back at the precinct building the crowd had grown in size to around a hundred as people returned from I-94 blockade in dribs and drabs. The atmosphere was less tense than it had been a few hours earlier. One man spoke through the loudhailer. “All lives matter!” he said. A woman grabbed it from him. “No,” she said. “That won’t be true until black lives matter.”",Yes,No,,No,,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c888b01a24dab3fb8b297c6b86c61092308c406/0_259_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=462487ca015215bf3376782fe6be4b8c,Yes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/jamar-clark-shooting-no-criminal-charges-for-minneapolis-police-officers,Jamar Clark shooting: no criminal charges for Minneapolis police officers,"Jamar Clark shooting: no criminal charges for Minneapolis police officers

 Save for later
A Minneapolis county attorney has decided not to press charges against two officers involved in the shooting of unarmed black man Jamar Clark in November.

Clark, 24, was shot by police in November following an altercation with two officers just yards from the precinct headquarters. He died a day later from his injuries.

Police have said he was shot during a struggle, but some eyewitnesses said Clark was already in handcuffs. Family members later described the shooting as “execution-style”.


However, county attorney Michael Freeman said the evidence did not suggest Clark was handcuffed at the time of the shooting, and that he was reaching for one of the officers’ gun. He also said Clark told the officers: “I am ready to die,” and that one of the officers described Clark as having “this thousand-yard stare”.

Following Clark’s death, a protest was organised around the hashtag #JusticeForJamar, which occupied the street outside the precinct building and, for a while, the lobby. Tensions ran high during the 18-day occupation, and protesters frequently clashed with police officers, who tried several times to demolish the camp.

A week later, protesters were attacked and shot at by four men believed to be white supremacists. According to eyewitnesses, police told protesters: “Isn’t this what you wanted?” when they came to the precinct building asking for help. They also pepper-sprayed protesters trying to help the wounded.

Freeman announced on 16 March that he would not use a grand jury to determine whether the two officers involved in Clark’s death should be charged, and would instead make the decision himself.

“The only time murder or manslaughter charges can be brought against a police officer is when the use of deadly force is not justified,” Freeman said on Wednesday. “To repeat, evidence must show that use of deadly force was not necessary to protect the officer and the public from harm.”

At a press conference on Wednesday, in which Freeman invoked the names of both Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, the county attorney said: “Police have a very difficult job. They are required to make split-second decisions in situations that are changing and evolving.”

He also called for advanced training methods in the de-escalation of violent situations, and said “police must use peaceful methods first, and be willing to tactically withdraw”.

Clark’s DNA was found on the handle of one of the officers’ gun, Freeman said, and there was no forensic evidence on Clark’s arm that would indicate he was handcuffed. He said that 10 law enforcement and paramedic witnesses – including the two officers involved – had said he was not handcuffed, though he admitted that the other witness accounts were conflicted.

At the press conference, one audience member told Freeman: “If the city burns, it is on your hands.”

San Bernardino County deputies fatally shot a man in an unincorporated area near Montclair on Wednesday, according to a sheriff’s spokeswoman.

Deputies shot the man after he was barricaded inside a house for more than an hour, said Jodi Miller, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

It’s unclear exactly why deputies opened fire.

“The investigation is underway regarding the details of the (deputy-involved shooting),” Miller said in an email.

Deputies went to a home in the 11100 block of Chico Avenue about 11:35 a.m. Someone reported a man was inside and threatened to blow up the house, Miller said.

At some point the man, identified as 52-year-old Ernesto Flores, started a fire inside the home, according to Miller.

After deputies shot him, Flores was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, she said.",No,,,,,,http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Vigil-Held-for-52-Year-Old-Man-Fatally-Shot-by-Deputies-300736001.html,Vigil Held for 52-Year-Old Man Fatally Shot by Deputies,"Vigil Held for 52-Year-Old Man Fatally Shot by Deputies

A Bakersfield Police Department officer shot a man early Sunday morning after he fired at an officer during a short foot chase in downtown Bakersfield, according to police.

The subject died later in a hospital.

But people who work and visit downtown said they do feel safe there, despite what happened.

Details of the incident were limited Sunday afternoon. Sgt. Mike Coronado said officers were taking the time needed to go carefully through the evidence before making any additional statement.

A single report on the shooting stated that officers were dispatched to the Padre Hotel at 18th and H streets at 2 a.m. Sunday for reports of a fight “between several subjects.”

LINKED ARTICLES
Man shot after allegedly firing at police Sunday has been identified
When officers arrived, the report stated, one of the subjects ran from officers. Officers pursued him.

Coronado said the confrontation started in the street in front of the Padre Hotel and proceeded across H Street to Wall Street Alley, where it ended just between the Wall Street Alley and the Downtown Deli Mart.

During the brief pursuit the subject pulled a gun and fired at one of the officers, the report stated.

The officer returned fire and struck the subject. The subject was taken to an unidentified local hospital where he was declared dead.

No one else was injured in the incident according to police reports.

Police have not identified the man killed in the incident or named the officer who fired the fatal shot. That officer has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a Critical Incident Review Board investigation.

Police detectives kept H Street between 18th and 19th Street blocked off until just before noon on Sunday.

A BPD patrol cruiser sat in Wall Street alley surrounded by yellow evidence marker cones, discarded medical gloves and packaging for life-saving equipment.

The Padre was busy with a pre-lunch crowd in the Brimstone bar and curious hotel patrons watched police at their work.

Some said they didn’t hear the commotion in the early morning hours.

Around the corner at the Hingepoint Church on 19th Street, church-goers said they feel safe downtown.

Mark Heimburger said the incident, for him, “kinda shows why we’re here. People need Jesus.”

Down the street Shawn Kinney was starting her shift at Jin Sushi.

She said she drove down to the area just after 2 a.m. Sunday to pick up her boyfriend from his job at an area bar. She said police swarmed around her car and rushed to lock down the scene of the shooting.

When Kinney came back just before noon, “I saw gun casings on the ground.”

She’s suspicious of police, she said, calling them the “biggest, deadliest gang in town.”

But she feels safe working downtown.

Just a couple days ago a homeless man walked into the restaurant with a new cellphone someone had lost, and gave it to her, hoping someone would find its owners.

Bakersfield City Councilman Terry Maxwell, who represents downtown Bakersfield, said he was sad to hear about the loss of life and said it’s unfortunate this kind of thing can still happen in the area.

“The improvements in the downtown area have made a lot of people safer,“ he said. ”We’ve done so much to get people to come downtown and enjoy themselves.“

In the past decade downtown Bakersfield has seen a surge of new businesses move into the area.

Maxwell said the downtown bar scene, which often turned violent in the past, has calmed down a lot. Years ago groups of bar-goers often congregated outside on the streets and fights broke out.

”I see more people walking from one place to another. The gangs of people walking around outside have gone away,” Maxwell said.

Maxwell also helps manage The Mark and said the restaurant shuts down just after midnight.

“I told the owners, ’Nothing good happens between midnight and 2 a.m.,’” Maxwell said.

Mixing hormones, late hours and alcohol is a recipe for trouble.

Sgt. Coronado of the BPD said the department generally has a robust presence downtown at closing time.

Maxwell said he’s pushing for more things to make downtown safe but Sunday’s officer-involved shooting is “something you cannot predict and you cannot totally prevent.”",Yes,No,,No,,"http://www.bakersfield.com/image/2015/11/29/740x600_q90_w/a4d74244-704e-4e7a-96c8-7503594206a9.jpg  ,

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. - A suspect is dead in an officer-involved shooting that occurred near a restaurant in Downtown Bakersfield early Sunday morning.

At around 2:00 am, Bakersfield Police officers were dispatched to the Padre Hotel on the intersection of 18th and H streets regarding a fight between several people.

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KBAK/KBFX) — A Bakersfield Police Department review board has ruled a pair of officer-involved shootings that happened late last year were within department policy.

The Critical Incident Review Board determined that the shots fired by Officer Danni Melendez on Dec. 4 and by Officer John Bishop on Nov. 29 were within department policy, as well as state and federal guidelines.

These shootings are not related, but the police department released its ruling on both Tuesday morning.

On Dec. 4, Melendez, who has been with the department less than two years, shot 31-year-old Jeriel Fite after a pursuit in the 800 block of south Haley Street.

Fite and another man, 21-year-old Reginald Moland Jr., were arrested and charged with attempted murder, firearm-related charges and gang enhancements stemming from a previous shooting on Pacheco Road.

On Nov. 29, Bishop, who has been with the department less than a year, shot and killed 23-year-old Hugo Fernando Celio after responding to a fight outside the Padre Hotel in downtown Bakersfield. Police say when officers arrived to the scene, Celio ran off, and officers ran after him.

Police said Celio then fired shots at one of the officers with a handgun in the Wall Street alley by The Mark. That's when they said Bishop fired back. Celio died at a hospital.

Troy Police investigate shooting at 112th Street on Sunday, August 23, 2015 in Troy, N.Y.
Troy
Two city police officers wounded in a Saturday night gunbattle in Lansingburgh that left a carjacking suspect dead are expected to recover, authorities said Sunday as competing depictions emerged of the man who allegedly opened fire on police.
The officers — Joshua Comitale, shot in both lower legs, and Chad Klein, who was hit in the back of the shoulder — were both recuperating under guard at Albany Medical Center Hospital on Sunday, police Chief John Tedesco said.

They became the first Troy officers shot in the line of duty in at least four decades, Tedesco said — a shocking end to what had already been a bloody week elsewhere in Troy.
Comitale, an evidence technician and member of the SWAT team who joined the force seven years ago, underwent two surgeries Sunday and was in stable condition, police spokesman Capt. Daniel DeWolf said. Klein, a father and nine-year veteran of the force who served in the Gulf War, was also in stable condition and under observation as doctors assess whether he needs surgery, DeWolf said.
Both men were wearing armored vests, but Tedesco declined to say whether their vests prevented more serious injuries.

Police shooting audio: ""I've been shot""
The man who police say opened fire on them, 39-year-old Thaddeus Faison of Albany, was shot repeatedly near the intersection of 112th Street and Fifth Avenue by at least one of the officers and was later pronounced dead at St. Mary's Hospital, police said.
Tedesco said Faison continued to struggle after being struck by multiple rounds from .45-caliber service weapons and officers then shocked him with a Taser.
Faison — who authorities said had a lengthy criminal record — was a suspect in a reported carjacking attempt at 114th Street and Second Avenue shortly before the shootout, police said.
""This suspect is not a kid,"" Tedesco said. ""He has a very violent criminal past.""
Faison served two stretches in state prison between 1999 and 2010 for weapons possession and drug sales and was returned twice for parole violations, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. He was not on parole Saturday because he served the maximum five-year sentence before he was released in 2010, DOCS said. Deputy Police Chief Richard McAvoy said he had eight felony arrests — four of them for alleged violent crimes.
Police said Faison had also been involved in a domestic dispute in recent weeks but said he was not arrested because the incident did not rise to the level of a crime.
Friends, however, grappled Sunday to reconcile that image with the man, known to them as ""T.O."", who they described as a dedicated father who less than two hours earlier had been at the supermarket buying formula for his 8-month-old twins.
""His kids did not want or need for nothing,"" said Billie Young, a friend of Faison's girlfriend. Faison's girlfriend lives in Troy and is the mother of at least three of Faison's children. ""Nobody's perfect. But they're making it out to be like he's this villain — and he's not.""
The chaotic series of events unfolded a block from 112th Street Park around 10:45 p.m. and began with an unusual police call. Comitale and Klein were responding to a report of an attempted gunpoint carjacking, police said. A random carjacking would be an unusual crime in Troy, Tedesco acknowledged. In this case, the call came from a friend of the alleged victim — not the victim himself.
Tedesco gave the following account of what happened next:
Comitale, the nearest officer to the scene, spotted Faison in the area and concluded he fit the description of the attempted carjacker. Comitale radioed for backup and eventually left his patrol car and began following Faison on foot. Faison began to run and Comitale gave chase.
At about that time, Klein turned onto 112th Street from Fifth Avenue and was almost immediately shot ""at point-blank range"" through the window of his patrol car.
""He pulled up to the scene to cut the suspect off where he had information he was located and this guy opened up on him,"" Tedesco said.
Klein was able to turn his car around, jump out and take cover. At that point, Faison opened fire on Comitale, who returned fire.
Tedesco would not comment whether Klein returned fire but estimated that as many as 20 shots were exchanged between the suspect and police, many of them peppering buildings on 112th Street.
The aftermath of the shootout left the neighborhood draped with yellow police tape for blocks in each direction Sunday as evidence technicians tried to make sense of the sprawling crime scene.
""It was a reckless environment where anyone could have been killed,"" Tedesco said.
Audio of police scanner chatter at the time of the shooting, which was being shared on Facebook on Sunday, depicts a frenetic, fast-unfolding scene.
Both officers reported that they had been shot. Comitale said the suspect was down but still moving. And Comitale had to give emergency responders directions about where he was taking cover between cars in the parking lot at Jimmy's Pizzeria.
McAvoy said the gunfight was captured on video by city surveillance cameras at the intersections.
Police could not immediately answer questions about the handgun they said they found in Faison's possession or how many shots he's believed to have fired.
Tedesco said authorities suspect Faison may have been under the influence of a drug, given the fight he put up even after being shot. But the chief said that could only be confirmed by toxicology tests that can take weeks.
""I do want to say without hesitation that at this juncture in the investigation we are supporting our officers 100 percent,"" Tedesco said, describing the shooting as ""self-defense.""
""There is nothing that leads us to believe that they acted outside of policy or beyond the scope of the law.""
Rensselaer County District Attorney Joel Abelove seconded that sentiment, saying his office would review the police department's findings but that the evidence so far suggests the officers ""acted bravely and heroically and incredibly professionally.""
Abelove said the shooting does not fall under a July executive order from Gov. Andrew Cuomo tasking Attorney General Eric Schneiderman with reviewing fatal encounters between citizens and police because that order only applies to the deaths of unarmed civilians.
""Every indication obviously here is that this individual was armed,"" Abelove said.
But those who knew Faison could only shake their heads at the police account. After walking to a nearby Hannaford to buy formula for his children around 9:15 p.m., Faison returned home to his girlfriend's place and began to eat dinner before he was interrupted by a phone call, Young said.
""It was one of his friends that said he needed him"" in the area of 114th Street and Third Avenue, said Young, who knew Faison for about five years. ""Like 15 minutes later, he's dead.""
Young said Faison's girlfriend was struggling with what to tell their 2-year-old child.
""She was at my house at 7:30 this morning,"" Young said. ""She's devastated.""
She added: ""I think this was a case of mistaken identity. I really do.""
Young said he also had children in Albany.
""He takes care of his kids,"" said Sharonda Howard, who is also close to Faison's girlfriend. ""He was definitely a family man.""
The shootout capped an already violent week elsewhere in the city that saw the slaying of a 19-year-old and wounding of a 14-year-old at Hutton Street and Old Sixth Avenue, just feet from where another teen was killed in May. Among the three charged in connection with this week's shooting was a 16-year-old.
Paul Gray, who lives diagonally across the 112th Street Park from the Saturday night shootout, suggested a link between Saturday's violence and increasing drug activity in recent years, which he said is encroaching on the generally quiet neighborhood.
""The traffic over the past three years has become super, super heavy,"" said Gray, 54, who said he confronts suspected drug dealers rather than calling the cops but won't let his 8-year-old play in the park. ""Cars pull up, you see the hand go in the window.""
Citing this month's arrest of 20 alleged members and associates of the Young Gunnerz drug gang, alleged to have held sway in the area of Old Sixth Avenue, Gray said law enforcement at times seems so focused on the big busts that the day-to-day crimes that force people like him to fight for their own blocks go unchecked. ""I'm not interested in the kingpin. What I'm interested in is it's not going to happen in this neighborhood,"" Gray said. ""This is my house. My family lives here. We own this neighborhood.""",Yes,Yes,"http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/41/00/8523834/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg  ,

Troy officers hospitalized in stable condition after shootout, gunman dead
Two Troy officers shot
TROY, N.Y. (NEWS10) – The Troy Police Department has identified the gunman involved in a shootout with two officers Saturday night.

Police identified the man as Thaddeus Faison of Albany.

The 39-year old was well-known to police throughout the Capital Region, according to Troy Police Captain Dan DeWolf.

Troy police responded to the area of 114th Street and 2nd Avenue Saturday night for a call of an attempted carjacking suspect with a gun.

Officer Joshua Comitale was closest to the scene and encountered the suspect, later identified as Faison, according to police. As the backup officer, Officer Chad Klein, came into the area, police said Faison began to flee.

Comitale gave chase and the suspect and the officers exchanged gunfire. Comitale sustained gunshot wounds to both of his lower legs, and Klein sustained a gunshot wound to the shoulder.

Faison also sustained gunshot wounds and continued to resist as officers were handcuffing him, police said. He later died of his injuries.

Troy
Marijuana and PCP were in Thaddeus Faison's system when he opened fire on two city police officers in August, triggering a gunfight that ended with him dead and the officers severely wounded.
Rensselaer County District Attorney Joel Abelove revealed that detail hours after a county grand jury decided not to file charges against Officer Joshua Comitale, who shot and killed the 39-year-old Albany man on the night of Aug. 22 after Faison shot Officer Chad Klein from behind at 112th Street and Fifth Avenue in Lansingburgh.
""His death is tragic,"" Abelove told reporters at a news conference Friday. ""Any lose of life is tragic. It could have ended much, much worse.""
""My heart does go out to the family of Mr. Faison because they lost someone as well,"" said Abelove, who spoke to Faison's relatives Friday morning. ""But the culpability in this case lies with Mr. Faison.""
Police Chief John Tedesco said he does not anticipate any demonstrations or problems in the community as a result of the grand jury decision.
In the days after the gunfight, street memorials were set up to recall Faison, known as ""T.O."" The memorials were a source of confrontation between police and some community members.
An Internal Affairs investigation continues into the shooting. All of the patrol officers who were on duty that night have made statements except Comitale and Klein. They are expected to be interviewed soon.
Tedesco estimated it could take up to a month to complete the internal review.
The gunfire on 112th Street near Fifth Avenue happened as Comitale and Klein were responding to a report of an armed man involved in an attempted carjacking. Abelove said they were watching Faison when he shot Klein, who was in an SUV, at ""point-blank range.""
Comitale returned fire and ""shot Mr. Faison who turned and engaged Mr. Comitale and shot him in the legs,"" the district attorney said.
People with knowledge of the incident described the firefight. They said Comitale's pistol jammed, and he reloaded while Faison shot at him.
Comitale and Klein were both hospitalized for several days and they remain out of work. They are not expected to be ready to return to work for 12 to 18 months.
""I don't consider this matter over until the two officers return to duty,"" Tedesco said.
A Rensselaer County grand jury issued a no true bill, meaning they did not find evidence Comitale committed a crime when he shot Faison.
Abelove and Tedesco stressed they were keeping the shooting investigation as transparent as possible.
Comitale was at Albany Medical Center Hospital for more than a week as medical workers treated severe injuries to both his legs. Klein was hospitalized for several days from a gunshot to the back of his shoulder.
Faison was taken to St. Mary's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The autopsy revealed the drugs in Faison's system. The level of the drugs was described as high by officials.
The gunbattle capped a sequence of events that unfolded after a 911 operator received a call from someone who reported that another person had been the target of a failed carjacking.
Comitale is a member of the department's emergency response, or SWAT, team. Comitale's firearms training, more intensive than that of most members of the 130-officer department, kicked in, allowing him to continue to fire even though he was severely wounded.
Near the end of the exchange, Comitale and Faison were both on the ground but continuing to fire, and Comitale apparently put a tourniquet on his legs to stem the loss of blood.
The wounding of Comitale and Klein has left their fellow officers cautious, but they continue to make the same number of arrests, Tedesco said.
The department has changed its training in response to the shootings, Tedesco said, and ""simulation rounds"" are now used in training to give officers a more realistic experience of what they may encounter on the streets.
Community policing must be more widespread across the department and not just limited to officers assigned to the community policing unit, the chief said.
""We're going to take a look at how we do community policing,"" Tedesco said.

Grayson County deputy involved shooting
GRAYSON COUNTY (WSLS 10) – One person is dead following a deputy involved shooting in Grayson County.

The sheriff’s office identified the man who was killed as Kenneth Ray Pinter Jr., 45, of Troutville. The deputy was not hurt in the incident.

The shooting happened just before 6 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 23, when a Grayson County deputy arrived at a home in the 12,000 block of Comers Rock Road while following up on two separate hit-and-run investigations that had occurred earlier in Wythe and Grayson counties.

While attempting to interview Pinter at the residence about the hit-and-run, the deputy approached him to conduct a pat-down for possible weapons.

According to state police, Pinter stepped away, presented a handgun and shot at the deputy. The deputy returned fire, striking Pinter. He was pronounced dead on scene.

Pinter’s remains have been transported to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Roanoke for examination and autopsy.

The investigation remains ongoing.

Once completed, Virginia State Police say their findings will be turned over to the Commonwealth’s Attorney for final review and adjudication.

The sheriff’s department first posted about the incident to their twitter page around 11 p.m. Wednesday night.

San Leandro: Oakland man identified as suspect killed by Alameda County deputies
A man suspected in a drive-by shooting and an attempted carjacking was fatally shot in unincorporated San Leandro by deputies who pursued him early Tuesday, an Alameda County Sheriff's Office spokesman said.

The drama unfolded at 12:49 a.m. when a drive-by shooting occurred in the 900 block of 105th Avenue in East Oakland, police said.

The victim suffered injuries not considered life-threatening and was taken to a hospital, and the shooting suspect drove away in a vehicle, Oakland police said.

At around 2:20 a.m., officers saw the suspected shooter driving a black Dodge Durango sport-utility vehicle on westbound Interstate 580 near 150th Avenue, Sheriff's Officie spokesman J.D. Nelson said.

Alameda County Sheriff's officers investigate a fatal officer-involved shooting of a suspect involved in multiple shootings and a chase that started in Oakland at the bottom of the onramp to Interstate 238 off East 14th Avenue in San Leandro, Calif., Tuesday, Sept. 22, 2015. (Laura A. Oda/Bay Area News Group) ( Laura A. Oda )
Officers ordered the suspect to pull over, but he drove away. Minutes later, officers found the Durango abandoned on I-580 near 164th Avenue.

Meanwhile, police received reports that a man -- whose description matched that of the driver -- had tried and failed to carjack a motorist and was seen running on nearby Interstate 238.

At 2:35 a.m., California Highway Patrol officers confronted the man on the freeway, near the E. 14th Street exit, Nelson said.

The suspect fired gunshots that struck a patrol car, then ran off the freeway in Ashland, an unincorporated county area near San Leandro, authorities said.

He ran into an alley next to the E. 14th Street offramp, where he engaged in a shootout with deputies who shot and killed him, Nelson said.

The suspect, who has not been identified, was pronounced dead at the scene.

No other injuries were reported.

As authorities investigated the fatal shooting, CHP officers closed the E. 14th Street exit from I-238.

A suspect who allegedly shot at California Highway Patrol officers and Alameda County Sheriff’s deputies following a carjacking in Oakland was killed in a “shootout” off the freeway near San Leandro, authorities said. (Published Tuesday, Sept. 22, 2015)
A suspect who allegedly shot at California Highway Patrol officers and Alameda County Sheriff’s deputies following a carjacking in Oakland was killed in a “shootout” off the freeway near San Leandro, authorities said.
Sheriff’s Sgt. JD Nelson said the suspect, a man in his 30s wearing a red hoodie, was fatally shot by deputies after a “shootout” with deputies near the East 14th Street off-ramp on northbound 238, which was closed during the police investigation.Traffic was backing up around the area at the start of the morning commute.

The suspect's death, Nelson said, came after he “fired at CHP officers” and his bullet struck a passing motorist. The person in that car was not injured, Nelson said, and it was just the car that was hit.
The violent morning began about 2 a.m. when a stolen Black Dodge Durango, was found along the westbound lanes of Interstate Highway 580 facing in the eastbound direction, Nelson said. The person whose SUV was stolen was also reportedly shot at, Nelson said. He did not know much else about that alleged shooting and carjacking.

Then, the sheriff’s department got a call about an attempted carjacking nearby, even though the car wasn’t stolen in that incident, Nelson said. Soon afterward, the CHP received word that a man wearing a red hoodie was walking on the freeway near the 238 connector between Oakland and San Leandro.
The suspect fired at CHP officers and took off, Nelson said. Deputies ended up finding him and got engaged in a “shootout” with sheriff’s deputies, who ended up killing him, Nelson said.

DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO — Two San Diego police officers shot and killed a man who aimed a pistol at them downtown Tuesday, authorities said.

The 39-year-old man was running into traffic and causing a disturbance when two motorcycle officers tried to contact him about 2:10 p.m. on F Street near Fifth Avenue. The man ran east down F Street as the officers followed. He stopped near Sixth Avenue, turned, pulled a semi-automatic from his backpack and pointed it at the officers, police Lt. Paul Rorrison said.

Rorrison said the officers told the man to drop the gun, but when he didn't, they fired at him. He fell to the ground, then sat up and raised the gun at them again. The officers repeatedly ordered him to drop his gun. He didn't comply, and both officers opened fire on him again.

The wounded man was taken by paramedics to a trauma center, where he died a short time later.

Capt. David Nisleit said police know the man's name, but it would not be released until his family is notified.

The officers were not injured.

Both officers were wearing body cameras, but neither of them turned on the devices during the incident, Nisleit said. He said there were many witnesses to the shooting and some made cellphone videos.

""I can tell you this happened very quickly,"" Nisleit told reporters. ""It went from them trying to get this guy to stop, to an immediate life-threatening incident.""

He said he hadn't yet examined the man's gun to see if it was real, or if it was loaded. It wasn't clear whether the man fired his weapon at officers.

The man was wanted on an armed robbery warrant from Virginia, and was considered armed and dangerous, Rorrison said.

The names of the officers were not released, but one has been on the Police Department for 30 years and the other for 25 years.

Two witnesses on F Street said they saw the man running toward them with the motorcycle officers following him. Monique Revel, 28, and Michael Tucker, 36, both of San Diego, said they saw one officer got off his bike, yell for the man to freeze, then fire at the man.

Tucker said he heard three shots, then a pause, then two or three more shots.

Thomas Ward, who was inside a building a block or two away, said he heard two volleys of about six rounds each.

“It made your skin crawl right away,” Ward said. “There was a lot of screaming and panic. It was disturbing.”

Other witnesses said police on F Street also fired a Taser at a woman, hitting her in the face with the dart.

It was not clear why the woman was Tased or if she had anything to do with the shooting.

Sixth Avenue and F Street were closed while police investigated.

The San Diego Police Department's policy on officer body-worn cameras, updated in July, states that ""Officers shall use the event mode to record enforcement related contacts. The event mode should be activated prior to actual contact with the citizen, or as soon as safely possible thereafter, and continue recording until the contact is concluded...""

The policy defines ""enforcement related contacts"" as including traffic stops, field interviews, detentions and arrests.""

Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman said in May that officers were to be trained to activate their body-worn cameras earlier in the process of responding to calls.

Her announcement came after Officer Neal Browder fatally shot Fridoon Zalbeg Rawshannehad in a Midway District alley in April. Browder did not turn on his camera, and said Rawshannehad came at him with a shiny object in his hand.

The object turned out to be a pen. A nearby security camera that recorded the encounter has not been released to the public.",Yes,No,,No,,"http://cdn.sandiegouniontrib.com/img/photos/2015/10/20/2441900_sd_me_shooting_HP_03_r900x493.JPG?122770e84b36f1c039d5c4c2ca15c2d8bc4ecd52  ,

San Diego police officers Tuesday afternoon shot and killed a 39-year-old man in downtown who had pointed a gun at them and refused demands to drop the weapon, police said.

The man had been ""causing a disturbance"" and blocking traffic in the Gaslamp Quarter when he was confronted by two motorcycle officers, Capt. David Nisleit told reporters.

The man fled on foot with the officers chasing him, Nisleit said. He turned on the officers and pointed a ""large-frame semiautomatic pistol,"" Nisleit said.

One officer fired, with the man falling to the ground, Nisleit said. The man then sat up and again pointed the gun, causing the second officer to fire, he said.

The officers felt ""an immediate threat to their lives,"" Nisleit said.

The man was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Preliminary investigation showed that he was wanted on a felony armed robbery warrant from Virginia, police said.

Neither officer had activated his body-camera, Nisleit said. But several bystanders captured the incident on their cameras, he said.

The dead man was later identified as Lamontez Jones. The gun pointed at officers was a replica, police determined.

The officers were Scott Thompson, a 30-year veteran, and Gregory Lindstrom, a 25-year veteran.

SAN DIEGO — District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis on Friday released video of three San Diego police officer-involved shootings, a reversal of her previous declarations that all such footage would be treated as evidence to be seen only in court.

“The position represents a major departure from historical practices, but we recognize the times have changed,” Dumanis said in a news briefing at her offices. “... This is really new territory.”

She said the legal rights of all the parties involved must be protected and balanced against the public’s desire to view such video.

“However, we know we live in a world where all kinds of video evidence is becoming more and more prevalent, as everybody uses their iPhones and androids and tablets, and they can go viral in minutes,” Dumanis said.

In the three review letters released Friday, all officers were found justified in shooting men they knew or believed were armed. One controversial fatal encounter in the Gaslamp District last fall involved two officers who fired repeatedly at a man who raised a gun in their direction twice, including after he was wounded. His gun turned out to be a fake.

Dumanis said she will release video, if it exists, from every officer-involved shooting unless the officer is to be charged with a crime. Then, she said, the video will be withheld until it is produced in a courtroom.

Such prosecutions have been rare – only six in the hundreds of shootings in the county since 1980. Prosecutors apply a legal standard that a shooting is legally justified if a reasonable officer in similar circumstances would have fired in self-defense or the defense of others. In most local cases, the officer was shot at, attacked with a lethal weapon, or believed the suspect was armed with a lethal weapon.

Dumanis said she came to her policy change in handling shooting videos after hearing from local law enforcement, citizen advisory groups and the media. Townhall-style meetings will be held to gather more input from residents, now that the first test cases have been released. Then, Dumanis said, her office will work to draft a written policy on releasing videos that takes the public perspective into account.

Townhall meetings
The public will be invited to discuss the release of officer-involved shooting videos at two upcoming meetings.
▪ May 11th at 6 p.m., Jacobs Center, 2nd floor, Chollas View Room, 404 Euclid Ave. San Diego and
▪ May 17th at 6:30 p.m., Cherokee Point Elementary School, 3735 38th St., San Diego.
Leaders of all the local law enforcement agencies in the county, including San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman, agree that pertinent video of officer-involved shootings should be released whenever possible, Dumanis said.

Zimmerman has said repeatedly over the past years, as more of her officers were outfitted with body-worn cameras, that she would not release their footage to the media or the general public. She expressed concerns that such videos would be viewed out of context, that the sheer volume of footage recorded each day would be too cumbersome to prepare for release, and that privacy rights could be violated.

On Friday, Zimmerman released a statement saying she supports the new protocol and that “having our public’s trust is essential to maintaining the safety of all of our communities.”

Members of the American Civil Liberties Union office in San Diego met with Dumanis during the video policy talks. Christie Hill, senior policy strategist for the ALCU locally, said the group supports the direction Dumanis is taking.

“It’s important that the information is released and it’s available to the public,” Hill said. “The public wants this information ... There is a call to more transparency.”

Hill said she agrees with Dumanis’ plans to edit the videos to blur the faces of those who are shot, and witnesses in the background. The officers’ faces also will be blurred. Dumanis also said the videos will be stopped at the point shooting stops, so officers’ further actions, such as approaching the wounded person, will not be shown.

The ALCU looks forward to seeing and responding to the District Attorney’s written policy once it is completed, Hill said.

Some other departments across the nation have released police camera footage showing officer actions ranging from gunning down a man who was running away to dancing or lip-syncing to popular tunes. Several officer-involved shootings of black men have sparked riots and raised calls call for reforms, spurring authorities to release video that showed the officers’ actions in better light.

A Washington post study last October found that among the 49 fatal shootings by police across the country since January that year that were captured on officer body cameras, the footage was released in only 21 cases.

Washington, D.C., is working to grant wide public access to police body camera videos. In many cities, Forth Worth, Texas; Sarasota, Fla.; to Baltimore, Md., police body camera footage is subject to the states’ public information laws. In Los Angeles, on the other hand, the policy allows for a copy of a police body camera recording to only be released in response to a valid court order or by approval of the police chief.

In San Diego, an officer-involved fatal shooting in April last year led to a public demand for the release of security camera footage showing the encounter. After getting a judge’s permission, Dumanis in December released video showing San Diego police Officer Neal Browder driving into an alley in the Midway District and firing at Fridoon Rawshan Nehad, who was walking toward the officer.

Dumanis said she was doing so to give the community a more complete picture of what had happened. Several people near an adult book store reported to police that a man was threatening people with a knife. Browder said he saw a shiny object in Nehad’s hand and Nehad ignored orders to drop the item and to halt. Police said he was later found to not have a knife.

Here are summaries of three shooting reviews released on Friday, and videos of the incidents released by the District Attorney. (Warning: videos contain graphic images.)

▪ The fatal shooting of Lamontez Jones, 39, in the Gaslamp Quarter on Oct. 20. It raised public concerns because some witnesses said officers fired a second volley at him after he was down. Videos shot from cellphones at two locations, and from a security camera showed Jones aim a pistol at motorcycle Officer Scott Thompson, who fired at him and wounded him. Jones fell to the street, then raised up a little and lifted the gun again. Thompson and Officer Gregory Lindstrom then shot him repeatedly.

They did not turn on their body-worn cameras. Zimmerman has defended that oversight, saying events moved too quickly. Jones’ mother has filed a claim of wrongful death against the officers, the city, and the San Diego Police Department.

He ditched his car, ran into some bushes and pulled a handgun from a backpack. He and officers Joshua Hodge and Mario Larrea exchanged gunfire. One body-worn camera showed the officer’s extended arm holding a gun and picked up his voice yelling for Fiel to get on the ground, then gunshots. Officer Heather Seddon was wounded in the neck by one of the officers’ rounds or a richochet.

He was in a stolen car and video from an elevated surveillance camera showed him back into a U.S. Marshal’s deputy’s car, then hit police Officer Brian Sanchez’ car. Sanchez walked in front of Taylor’s vehicle and Taylor pulled forward, hitting Sanchez. Sanchez fired four rounds into the windshield, wounding Taylor.

Dumanis said she plans to release reviews of officers shootings, and related videos, on a more timely basis than has been done in the past year. She said there are about 11 cases with completed reviews, and those will be released a few a time in coming months.

An officer who shot and killed a Boise man at a home on Malad Street in February will not face criminal charges because he was acting within Boise Police Department policy and protecting his fellow officers and the neighborhood, the department announced Thursday.

Here’s what happened, according to a BPD news release detailing the findings of an independent review:

On Feb. 16 around 1:20 a.m., police responded to calls reporting a disturbance. Witnesses said Michael Kenneth Casper, 26, of Boise was breaking windows with a crowbar. BPD Officer Jason Green was the first to arrive on scene; he heard breaking glass and gunshots. He approached Casper’s residence and heard two more shots. Casper was in the house near a window, holding a gun, according to the news release.

Green asked Casper to lower his weapon three times, but Casper shouldered the weapon as if preparing to fire. The weapon was pointed in the direction of another police officer who was approaching in the residential neighborhood. Green fired three shots at the wall in front of Casper. Casper pulled back, then pointed the gun out of the window. Green shot up to five more shots.

Neighbors were evacuated. When a SWAT team entered the house, they found Casper dead. Investigators found multiple shots into vehicles, fences and houses across the street from Casper’s house, consistent with Officer Green’s account.

Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs was brought on to review the fatal shooting to determine whether to press charges against Green. The Ada County Critical Incident Task Force routinely requests independent reviews of officer-involved shootings.

“After a review of all the available evidence, which included autopsy reports, witness interviews, crime scene photographs, etc., I have concluded that the death of Mr. Casper was the result of Officer Green’s lawful use of deadly force in the attempt to defend himself, other law enforcement officers, and members of the public from Mr. Casper, who was then shooting a firearm at police who responded to a disturbance at his house,” Loebs said in a statement provided by BPD.

Bill Bones, BPD chief of police, agreed with the outcome of the prosecutor’s review.

“The actions of the suspect placed his neighbors and responding officers in extreme danger. Considering the first officer, Officer Green, arrived on scene as shots were being fired toward neighboring homes, toward himself and toward other officers, his response to the violent actions of the suspect likely saved others from serious harm,” Bones said in a statement.

According to his obituary, “Mikee” Casper was a lifelong Boise resident who graduated from Boise High School and worked at Winco Foods for eight years.

Boise Man Remembered Following Officer-Involved Shooting
By George Prentice @georgepren
About 100 friends, family and acquaintances gathered at the Idaho Building on Feb. 23 to honor the memory of 26-year-old Michael Casper, who was killed in a police-involved shooting at his home on Feb. 16
George Prentice
About 100 friends, family and acquaintances gathered at the Idaho Building on Feb. 23 to honor the memory of 26-year-old Michael Casper, who was killed in a police-involved shooting at his home on Feb. 16

Amanda Casper needed to clear her head. As she walked by a Boise pawn shop Feb. 23, the violent death of her brother, Michael Casper, only one week prior, was still fresh in her mind and heavy on her heart.

""And I saw a skateboard in the pawn shop. I just had to buy it,"" Amanda said. ""I rode it at a local skatepark today, and I just knew if I fell, Michael would catch me. I felt Michael was with me today.""

As she spoke, two skateboards sat a few feet away, propped against a wreath of daisies wrapped in a white sash with the words, ""In loving memory of Michael Casper."" The back room of the Idaho Building, which comfortably accommodates 15 people, was packed with about 50 mourners on the afternoon of Feb. 23. A line of nearly 50 more people, young and old, snaked out the door, down a hallway and onto Eighth Street. Some were fellow skateboarders, some were former co-workers and quite a few were members of Casper's extended family.

""My son looks just like Michael,"" said Amanda.

Turning to look at the photo of her late brother, she began to sob.

""Whoever was with him that night he was shot should have stayed him him,"" Amanda said, her voice rising. ""None of this would have happened.""

She then fell into the arms of Pastor Renee McCall, who presided over the memorial. Amanda's next words were clearly audible.

""Damn it, Chris,"" she said.

Chris McIntire may have the most to say about what exactly happened to Michael Casper in the early morning hours of Feb. 15, when the 26-year-old was fatally shot by Boise police following an early morning disturbance at his duplex.

""To be honest, there's still a lot of conjecture and hearsay,"" McIntire told Boise Weekly. ""I was with him that night. I think I can say exactly what happened. But the reasons should remain between him and his family.""

That's quite different from the stance McIntire took in the days after the incident, when he took to Facebook to welcome any and all people curious about the events of leading to Casper's death to contact him directly.

""If anyone has questions about Michael Casper and his death, please contact me,"" wrote McIntire. ""I was with him the night of the shooting and was the last person to speak to him. We became brothers, and a part of me is now gone. There is much confusion surrounding the events of that night. I am grieving and my heart is heavy, but he needs the air to be cleared. Call me day or night.""

The Facebook post, which included McIntire's personal phone number, has since been deleted.

The sparse details of the incident—the who, what, when and where—may satisfy the curious, but none of the information eases the grief of the tragedy. The circumstances surrounding the death of Casper, shot by a Boise police officer, remain a mystery; and what has followed has been a mini social-media firestorm.

Pastor McCall, who is also Casper's aunt, cautioned those attending his memorial service.

""[Don't] pay any attention to the nastiness that has been printed in the newspapers,"" she said. ""What they're saying about Michael isn't true.""

McIntire agreed.

""Objective, my ass,"" he said, referring to previous media accounts of the Feb. 16 incident. ""There are a lot of stories out there, and I believe it will make more sense a year from now. For now, his family and I have to do some soul-searching to come to terms with everything.""

According to those friends and family BW spoke to, Casper had everything to live for. No one knew that more than his mother, Fran Gough, who gave birth to Casper on Oct. 12, 1988.

""Mikee—that's what all of his family called him—Mikee was always dreaming big,"" said Gough. ""He never spoke negatively about anybody. He was always there with grace when someone wanted something. He'll live on in a lot of people's hearts.""

Mike Casper was remembered as a ""lovely young man"" who ""was going everywhere. He never sat still."" - GEORGE PRENTICE

Mike Casper was remembered as a ""lovely young man"" who ""was going everywhere. He never sat still.""
Casper, who took his last name from father, Ron Casper, also of Boise, was the middle child of three: his sister Laura the oldest, his sister Amanda the youngest. By the time Casper graduated from Boise High School in 2007, he had already moved into his own apartment and was working as an order selector at the Winco Distribution Center in southeast Boise. Over the next several years, Casper acquired and sold some property and a few months before his death, he founded Idaho Solar Power, a Boise-based alternative energy firm.

""He had more hopes and dreams than anyone I ever knew,"" said Gough. ""He was going everywhere. He never sat still.""

Casper was on the fast track. He would park his Harley-Davidson motorcycle inside, telling family and friends that being ""able to park your Harley in the front room"" was one of the perks of being single.

""But skateboarding was his absolute passion. He would skateboard at City Hall, behind schools and anywhere with stairs,"" said Gough, adding that her son gravitated to the mountains in the winter. ""And snowboarding. Oh my, yes, snowboarding.""

Gough was eager to share memories of happier days, but she took a long pause as she looked at the clock.

""I have to go pick up Mikee's ashes,"" she said. ""He'll be staying with his mother from now on.""

Gough didn't talk much about the questions surrounding her son's death, but she's certain that there are too many inconsistencies with the events of Feb. 16.

""I think there was somebody else involved. The cops say there wasn't, but I truly think somebody was with him,"" she said.

McIntire later told BW he was certain that Casper's choices that fateful night—including the fact that Casper was brandishing a weapon—were not ""suicide by cop.""

""I wanted to clear the air a little bit,"" McIntire said. ""There are a lot of stories that the police are trigger-happy. I can dispel that myth. I would appreciate it if a lot of people on Facebook would leave it alone.""

McIntire's on-again, off-again desire to disclose the details of what happened doesn't sit well with a few other of Casper's close friends, including Matthew Moss, who said that he was puzzled by how anxious McIntire was to ""get his story out,"" at least initially.

""Did you see that Facebook post?"" asked Moss, who met Casper when the two worked together at Winco. ""It's a little overboard, the way he's trying to put his stuff out. Chris [McIntire] calls me out of the blue on the night after the shooting and proceeds to tell me his side of the story.""

Standard protocol indicates the public will not get the results of the full investigation for months, but this is what we do know: Casper and McIntire were together on the night of Feb. 15 and into the early morning hours of Feb. 16. They had gone to a bar and returned to Casper's home in a duplex at Malad and Gourley streets on the Bench. Moss told BW that McIntire and his girlfriend had an argument earlier that evening, and McIntire had asked to spend the night at Casper's place. What happened between the time the two returned to Casper's from the bar and a short time later when Casper was fatally shot by a Boise police officer is still being investigated.

The Ada County Critical Incident Task Force is taking the lead in the probe. The task force includes members of the Garden City, Meridian and Boise police departments; the Ada County Sheriff's Office; and the Idaho State Police.

Following the shooting, an official statement from the Boise Police Department said officers heard a crashing sound and what sounded like gunshots coming from inside Casper's home. Police also said bullet holes were later discovered in a home across the street and in a nearby car. BPD officer Jason Green, a six-and-a-half-year veteran of the force, was the first on the scene after neighbors alerted police to the sound of smashing glass. The police report indicated Green attempted to contact Casper, but when he pointed a gun at another officer, Green fired, striking him in the chest. The following day, Ada County Coroner Dotti Owens, (who was sworn into her new position a few weeks ago), ruled that Casper died of a gunshot wound to the chest.

""Chris [McIntire] said Mike [Casper] was acting real weird and depressed, which is completely untrue, because we all talk to him regularly and he's happier than hell, and there's a whole bunch of things to back this up,"" said Michael Burns, who had known Casper since the young man was 18 years old.

""I believe [McIntire's] story fits very well for the police,"" he told BW in a phone conversation Feb. 20, ""because they don't want my story to be true, which is that these two got in an altercation, [McIntire] wanted in the house, and he acted like a maniac. Mike went to get his gun and started shooting—the guy's breaking his windows out. Mike shoots out at him, hits the car and the house across the street, and the guy leaves. The cops come back and see him waving the gun and shoot him.

""That's what I believe. Something along those lines, and they don't like that story, because it kind of makes them look bad a little bit, instead of maybe talking to [Casper] first.""

Sadness, frustration and even anger hung heavy over the Feb. 23 memorial. More than a few mourners had their own theories on what might have happened to their friend, but the one thing they all had in common was a deep sorrow.

""I've been crying for three or four days... hard,"" said Burns in an earlier conversation. ""He was such a lovely, lovely young man.""

One by one, tearful family and friends stood next to the memorial skateboards, wreath and photograph of Casper. A montage of images was projected on a far wall, chronicling his 26 years: photographs of him as a baby; as a boy at beaches and county fairs; playing make-believe in an oversized cowboy hat and boots; celebrating Christmases and Halloweens; and multiple pictures of Casper aboard his beloved skateboard.

As one image dissolved into another, ""Godspeed"" by the Dixie Chicks was played: ""Oh my love will fly to you each night on angel's wings / Godspeed / Sweet dreams.""

A few days after first speaking with BW, Burns stood at the front of the memorial service for Casper, who had lived with Burns' family for four years.

""We talked all the time. And we usually talked about God, girls and love. There wasn't ever a conversation that the two of us had that didn't end with us saying 'I love you' to one another,"" said Burns, who also read letters from his two children—a 10-year-old and a 6-year-old—saying how much they missed Casper.

Before he could read through the letters, Burns also dissolved into tears and was unable to finish his words.

Family and friends of Michael Casper gathered with candles and roses in front of his former residence at Malad and Gourley streets Tuesday night.

One year earlier, the 27-year-old Winco employee was fatally shot as he stood at a window. Boise Police had responded to reports of a man breaking windows and firing a gun at that residence, and Officer Jason Green opened fire after the man refused to lower his gun and appeared to be pointing it toward an approaching officer, police and an independent investigator said.

Friends and family have challenged the findings that ruled Casper’s shooting justified, but his sister, Amanda Casper, told the 14 adults and four children gathered for a vigil Tuesday that they should “close the book” on hard feelings about the shooting and Officer Green.

Instead, she said, those who loved Mike, aka Mikee, should focus on memories of him skateboarding, playing video games and enjoying life.

“Let’s not bring up the whole investigation thing,” Amanda Casper said. “It just gets the family shook up.”

Casper’s mother, Fran Hopkins of Boise, thanked people for remembering her son, saying, “I can’t explain or describe how good of a kid Mike was. Bless his heart, I don’t think he had an enemy — not one.”

According to his obituary, Casper was a lifelong Boise resident who graduated from Boise High School and worked at Winco Foods for eight years.

According to an investigation Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs completed in October, Officer Green first fired into a wall in front of Casper and then fired again when the man pointed his gun out of the window. The neighborhood was evacuated, and police found Casper dead inside the house.

A man who ignored police commands to drop a large steel pole was killed by a Mesa officer Thursday night, authorities said.

Officers responded to a call at 10 p.m. from residents in a gated community near Ridgecrest and McDowell roads. Upon arriving, police found a man, later identified as 47-year-old Ivan Krstic, beating an approximately 3-foot steel pole on the ground and talking erratically, according to a Police Department spokesman, Detective Steve Berry.

Berry said Friday that officers shot Krstic with a Taser when he refused to drop the pole. Krstic fell to the ground but got back to his feet when the electric current from the Taser stopped, picked up the pole and turned toward the officers.

At that point, one officer shot Krstic with a pistol, Berry said. He was transported to a hospital and later died of his injuries.

Krstic was a resident of the neighborhood where the incident happened, Berry said later Friday.

He said Krstic had a previous encounter with police in the same neighborhood.

In August 2012, Krstic told police summoned to his home that he had a large-caliber rifle and would use it if officers approached. According to Berry, the neighborhood and Las Sendas Elementary School were locked down for hours until SWAT officers and negotiators talked him out of the residence.

Krstic was arrested for disrupting the school and for making threats, Berry said. He did not specify the disposition of that case.",Yes,No,,No,,http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a2994877f71f6f98e91b5c229c732203eba8cbf0/c=0-727-2154-3600&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/12/04/Phoenix/Phoenix/635848210700546924-cop-camera003.jpg,http://www.abc15.com/news/region-southeast-valley/mesa/pd-suspect-hospitalized-after-officer-involved-shooting-in-mesa,PD: Suspect dead after officer-involved shooting in Mesa,"PD: Suspect dead after officer-involved shooting in Mesa

Suspect With Metal Pipe Shot By Mesa Police


KNXVSHOW CAPTION



MESA, AZ - A suspect was shot and killed during an officer-involved shooting in Mesa Thursday night.

The incident happened around 10:30 p.m. near Power and McDowell roads.

Mesa police tell ABC15 no officers were injured, but that the suspect was taken to the hospital where he later died.

He has since been identified by police as 47-year-old Ivan Krstic.

According to information on scene, police say Krstic  was walking around a gated community with a metal pipe. A resident nearby confronted the man before calling police.

When officers arrived, they told Krstic to drop the pipe before shooting him with a stun gun when he did not comply. He then ran at the officers with the pipe, so officers shot at him.

Krstic reportedly lived in the neighborhood and had threatened officers in the same area in August 2012. In that case, police say he had a large-caliber rifle and stated that he would use it if approached by police.

No charges will be filed in December 2015 Mesa police shooting

No charges will be filed in the December shooting of a Mesa man in the gated community of Las Sendas, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery announced Thursday.

Ivan Krstic, 47, was shot by a Taser and then a pistol by Mesa police officers on the evening of Dec. 3 after officers said he ignored commands to drop a large steel pole.

The shooting was justified given the threatening circumstances the officers were facing, Montgomery said at a news conference. Krstic was 7 feet away from an officer when Krstic got up after being stunned by a Taser, Montgomery said.

Prosecutors did look at officers' body-camera video but ""couldn't just look at the video and draw a conclusion from that,"" Montgomery said, so they also assessed three 911 calls related to the situation and forensic evidence.

The body-camera video was shown by Montgomery and made public.

Troy Hendrickson, an attorney representing Krstic's surviving family members, in April filed a $10 million civil case against the city of Mesa in Maricopa County Superior Court after he said the family's initial wrongful-death complaint to the city went unanswered for months.

On Thursday, Hendrickson said the family was upset by Montgomery's decision and ""feels victimized again.""

Hendrickson called the fatal shooting unjustified, deeming the officers' conduct as outrageous and extreme.

Disturbance in Las Sendas

Krstic was killed in his gated Las Sendas neighborhood about 10 p.m. when police found him in the street around his home banging a 3-foot steel pole and attempting to lift manhole covers, police reports state.

According to Hendrickson, Krstic, a father of two young children, was scheduled to meet with representatives of his homeowners association the next morning to discuss water leakage under and surrounding his property near McDowell and Power roads. Krstic was checking for indications of a water leakage under the asphalt, Hendrickson said.

Montgomery said three people called 911 to alert authorities to what they called Krstic's ""erratic"" behavior.

Police reports released Thursday describe what witnesses who encountered Krstic told officers.

Sanja Krstic told police her husband had left their residence talking to himself and not making any sense. She said she last saw him trying to open both garage doors as she kept trying to shut them.

The only items he had in his possession, she said, were his cellphone and Leatherman multi-tool knife, which he always carried.

Resident John Linton and his friend Bryan McCormick, who were witnesses to the shooting, observed Krstic pounding the ground with the metal pipe and asked him what was going on. Krstic replied he was checking the compaction of the soil and pavements in the neighborhood and that he would ""go after the builder.""

One of the men recognized Krstic as someone who previously had been arrested after a SWAT team got involved.

Remembering that, McCormick and Linton were concerned Krstic was mentally ill or under the influence of drugs, realizing that he ""was not all there,"" the police report said.

McCormick called 911, describing Krstic as ""acting crazy"" and saying he was concerned about Krstic's behavior.

McCormick and Linton then got into a vehicle and continued to observe Krstic, who was in the middle of a street still clutching the metal bar.

They saw Officer Dustin Gransee and Officer Dan Glover arrive in the neighborhood.

A message ignored: 'Stay down' 

During Thursday's news conference, Montgomery showed Axon body-camera footage of the encounter between Krstic and the officers.

Footage shows Gransee and Glover exiting their vehicles with flashlights and handguns as Krstic walked toward them on the street. Both officers told him several times to ""drop the metal bar.""

Police records state Gransee told Glover he had lethal coverage and Glover holstered his gun, instead opting to use a Taser. Both continued to give verbal commands to Krstic, and when Krstic approached within 10 feet of them, Glover deployed the Taser, striking Krstic in the groin and knocking him to the ground on his back.

Krstic pulled the probes out of his skin and Glover can be heard yelling ""knife"" multiple times after spotting the 3-inch blade of a utility knife in Krstic's right hand.

The footage briefly shows Kristic holding the knife while getting up from the ground, which Montgomery characterized as a ""silver flash"" that had ""a dramatic effect"" on the situation.

Glover backed up and deployed his Taser again, but it ""seemed to not have any effect,"" the police report said. Both officers again commanded Krstic to stay down.

As Krstic got up, he dropped the knife and grabbed the pole with both hands, moving diagonally in a manner that looks in the video like he's shuffling away from officers. Montgomery said the 45-degree angle at which Krstic was moving was reducing the space between him and the officers. Krstic wasn't moving away from them, Montgomery said.

Gransee fired two rounds from 7 feet away, striking Krstic in the chest and right arm, records state. Krstic dropped to the ground onto his stomach and the officers kicked the bar out of the way.

Krstic was transported to HonorHealth Scottsdale Osborn Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. A toxicological analysis showed Krstic tested positive for alcohol, amphetamines, anti-anxiety drugs and antidepressants at the time of his death.

""This interaction ended with the loss of life, which is tragic for Mr. Krstic and his family. And that fact shouldn't be lost,"" Montgomery said. ""In reviewing the totality of what we could find, in reviewing the video and objective information involving forensic evidence at the scene, our officer-involved shooting protocol being followed and a thorough review by prosecutors, at the end of the day, the conclusion is that these actions are permissible under Arizona law and we will not be filing a charge in this particular case.""

A history of mental illness

When investigators contacted Krstic's family, they reported that Krstic had suffered from psychological problems for years and was bipolar. He would have good times and bad times, they said.

Krstic's wife became concerned after she heard sirens while her husband was outside and called family members. She said Krstic had moved back into the house in November after staying at his parents' home after a recent stint in jail.

She said he wanted to be with her and his children, but that that he wasn't acting like himself.

His mother, Nadezda ""Nada"" Krstic, said she first observed Krstic suffering from mental illness during college, noticing him acting ""off"" when he would return home from school. He had recently become unstable after he had stopped taking antipsychotic medication; he also took barbiturates and alprazolam, which treats anxiety and panic disorder, the police report said.

8 previous calls to police

Krstic had a history with Mesa police dating back to November 2009 but had no felony convictions. From 2009 to 2014, Krstic was involved in eight calls to the Mesa Police Department, ranging from a missing-persons call to psychiatric committals.

A period of five calls in 21 days included two calls that centered on the Las Sendas Elementary School, beginning with Krstic threatening the principal after Krstic appeared to not be making sense during his contact with school staff. The following day, Krstic was placed on a mental-health detainer by authorities after he had been admitted to the hospital with a large laceration on his forehead.

Nearly three weeks later, in August 2012, Krstic called police and threatened to burn down his house, shoot at police with a large-caliber rifle and cause problems at the school. Detective Steve Berry, a Mesa police spokesman, said the neighborhood and Las Sendas Elementary School were locked down for hours until SWAT officers and negotiators talked Krstic out of the residence.

Krstic was arrested the following month on suspicion of disruption of a school and making threats, although it appears no charges were pressed either in municipal court or Maricopa County Superior Court.

Civil complaint remains against city

Montgomery made clear in his remarks that the decision to not press charges was not meant to be taken as a comment on the Krstic family's loss or ""diminish at all how much he meant to his loved ones.""

Hendrickson disagreed.

""Ivan Krstic was lawfully walking the streets of his neighborhood, was of no threat to any person or property, including the officers, and was shot and killed for no legally justifiable reason,"" the April 11 complaint filed by Hendrickson stated. ""He never spoke to, advanced toward or made any threatening gestures or movements at the officers.""

The complaint was filed after city officials did not respond to a wrongful-death claim filed Jan. 25, Hendrickson said.

The Krstic family lawsuit is the second multimillion-dollar claim facing the city over an officer-involved shooting.

Daniel Shaver, an exterminator from Texas, was killed by former Mesa Officer Phillip ""Mitch"" Brailsford at a hotel on Jan. 18. Brailsford has been charged with second-degree murder in Shaver's death. An attorney for his widow, Laney Sweet, filed a $35 million wrongful-death claim against the city of Mesa on Feb. 8. A civil lawsuit is expected to be filed within the next few months independent from the criminal case.

The incident began about 4:30 p.m. after a resident called 911 about a suspicious woman in the 13000 block of Beach Street in Cerritos.

""There was a female knocking on doors asking for people inside the residence that didn't live there,"" Lt. Eddie Hernandez said.

When a deputy responded to the neighborhood, he spotted a car matching the caller's description with a woman standing nearby. The deputy detained the woman and approached the car, according to a news release from the Sheriff's Department.

Authorities had initially reported that multiple people were detained, but later clarified that only the one woman was being held for questioning.

""As (the deputy) got closer to the vehicle, he saw that the driver ... looking like he was trying to conceal himself from the deputy,"" Hernandez said.

The driver appeared to be ""fumbling around in his pocket and waist area,"" Hernandez said.

When the deputy ordered the driver to show his hands, the man accelerated forward, striking the deputy, the release stated.

""Fearing for his safety, the deputy fire at the suspect,"" Hernandez said.

The man continued driving and was followed by a patrol vehicle, according to the release. He lost control in the 17200 block of Pires Avenue, about a half-mile away, and crashed into a fire hydrant and electrical pole, triggering an explosion, authorities said.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has released the name of the stick-wielding Bartow County man killed Tuesday by a sheriff’s deputy.

GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said in an emailed statement that the man had been identified as 47-year-old Darren Billy Wilson. The Bartow County sheriff’s deputy who shot him was Anthony Parker, Lang said.

According to previously released information, Bartow authorities responded to Spring Place Road in the town of White at about 3:20 p.m. Tuesday after they “received a call regarding a man who had a large stick and was threatening the caller.” Two deputies responded and encountered the man now identified as Wilson, who was wearing only boxer shorts and a baseball hat.

“The man charged one of the deputies with the stick and was yelling threats at the deputy,” Lang said. “The other deputy (Parker) then shot the man.”

Wilson was pronounced dead at the scene. Neither deputy was hurt.

The GBI is investigating the shooting and will present its findings to Bartow’s district attorney.

 Darren Wilson shooting police report 
Posted: Saturday, December 19, 2015 7:00 am
Two Bartow County deputies in the woods trying to subdue a man wielding a stick led to a shooting that left the suspect dead in July, according to a copy of the initial report released Friday to the Rome News-Tribune.
The Bartow County Sheriff’s Office released the report after an open records request filed by the newspaper.
The account reveals specifics about the shooting of 47-year-old Darren Billy Wilson, of 566 Cass Pine Log Road, Rydal.
The incident occurred July 21 in White.
Deputy Anthony Parker and Deputy Nick Thompson were previously placed on paid administrative leave after the incident. Parker fired the shots.
Both were reinstated, Sheriff Clark Millsap said in an earlier interview. He declined to provide Thompson’s name but it was included in the narrative.
According to the incident report:
Parker was dispatched to 318 Mansfield Road after a man called in to report a possible fight in the woods behind his house.
The caller told Parker an unidentified male was yelling and no one was supposed to be in there.
Before entering the woods, Parker waited for Thompson to show up.
They initially had trouble finding the man, later identified as Wilson. Thompson said they walked into the woods on a four-wheeler trail, but eventually had to walk through a heavily-wooded area to find Wilson.
“I could hear the male talking about the devil and going to kill someone,” Parker said in the narrative.
Parker said he originally couldn’t see Wilson, but Thompson could. He wrote that Wilson was sitting up against a tree, holding something in his hands. Thompson stated Wilson was only wearing boxer shorts and tennis shoes.
After Parker got into a good position, he noticed Wilson was holding a large tree branch across his body like someone would hold a gun.
Thompson yelled at the man to “show me your hands, show me your hand” multiple times. Wilson stood up and began walking toward Thompson with the stick out in front of him and yelling at him.
Wilson began running toward Thompson in an aggressive manner, so Thompson said he began to backpedal and waited on an opportunity to fire his stun gun, according to the narrative.
However, he said he didn’t fire the stun gun because Wilson was holding the branch in a position that made the stun gun ineffective.
Parker, in the meantime, said he became tangled in a fallen tree and vines and had lost sight of the two men while trying to get free.
When he finally saw them, Wilson was charging Thompson, Parker wrote.
Parker fired his gun at least three times at Wilson, according to the narrative. He wrote that the first two shots made Wilson stumble, but he continued toward Thompson.
The deputy fired again, and Wilson didn’t get back up, according to the narrative.
Bartow County District Attorney Rosemary Greene, who was unavailable for comment Friday, said in an earlier interview that she is still reviewing the GBI investigation into the shooting.",Yes,No,,No,,"http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/3d/63d85452-3175-11e3-a13e-0019bb30f31a/5256498381456.image.jpg?resize=300%2C77  ,

 Darren Wilson shooting police report 
Posted: Friday, March 4, 2016 7:00 am
From staff reports
Two Bartow County Sheriff’s deputies responsible for shooting and killing a branch-wielding man last year have been cleared of any wrongdoing, Cherokee Judicial Circuit District Attorney Rosemary Greene said.
The GBI was called in to investigate the July 21, 2015, shooting and killing of 47-year-old Darren Billy Wilson, of 566 Cass Pine Log Road in Rydal.
Deputy Anthony Parker shot and killed Wilson, who was wearing only boxer shorts and holding a large tree branch in his hands, according to previous reports.
Deputy Nick Thompson tried to use his stun gun on Wilson but was unable to because they were in a wooded area, according to a GBI incident report.
Both men were placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting, but were reinstated prior to Greene’s decision.

AUSTIN (KXAN) — A gunman who shot and killed a bystander at a busy Downtown Austin hotel was shot and killed by Austin police officers, according to police.

Police say they received a 911 call at 4:48 a.m. Sunday saying there was a man walking around with a gun in the lobby of the Omni Hotel at 700 San Jacinto Boulevard. The 911 operator said they could hear crying and yelling in the background. Two minutes later, the caller said the man had shot someone.

When police arrived one minute later, they saw a man carrying a rifle. There was also a body on the ground. Police say the suspect then pointed the rifle at them.

“When the officers arrived on scene, they did engage in gunfire with the suspect,” explained Austin Police Department Chief of Staff Brian Manley. “The suspect ran into the hotel, and the officers gave chase into the hotel — ultimately encountering the suspect off to the side near the restaurant, where they again engaged in gunfire.”

One officer shot at the suspect and killed him. The officer involved in this case has been with the Department for five years and will be placed on administrative duty during the investigation.

According to police, there is no evidence the gunman knew the victim who was shot dead in the lobby.

“We don’t have any information at this point that leads us to believe this was anything other than random,” said Manley.


“All of sudden [I heard] ‘Pop, pop, pop.’ And I’m like, ‘What is that?’ And [my girlfriend] goes, ‘Oh, it’s just fireworks,'” said Matt Reasor, who was staying at the Omni Hotel.

Hotel guests woke up to a crime scene Sunday morning.

“It was kind of scary because we had just gotten in not even an hour before that happened,” said Stacey Lindsay, another person staying at the hotel. “So, had we gotten in anytime later, who knows what would have happened.”

Less than an hour before the downtown shooting, Austin police officers were also involved in a deadly shooting on Golden Quail Drive on the city’s northside.

9 a.m. update: Austin police offered new details about two early Sunday morning shootings — on in North Austin and one in downtown — in which three people were killed, including two people fatally shot by officers.

Assistant police Chief Brian Manley said it was still early in the investigation, but the shooting that happened at the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown appeared to be a random attack by a gunman, described to be in his 30s.

Police received a call around 4:50 a.m. Sunday about a man in the hotel lobby with a gun, Manley said. The 911 call taker could hear crying and yelling in the background, he said, and was told that a man had just shot someone.

Officers arrived at the hotel a few minutes later and confronted a gunman who was carrying a rifle, Manley said. The man ran into the hotel and officers chased him before exchanging gunfire near the hotel restaurant, he said.

The gunman was killed by police; officers found a second man dead who they think was killed by the gunman.

The officer involved in killing the gunman is a five-year veteran and has been placed on administrative leave, as is customary in police shootings, Manley said.

At about 5 a.m. Lance Flores, who was staying in the Omni Hotel overnight, was getting ready to leave when he saw a body on the lobby floor and about six police officers. One of the officers directed him back upstairs. Flores said he was in shock.

“I was just thinking, ‘What the hell,’ ” he said. “There’s a dead guy lying on the floor.”

Another guest, a woman who did not want to be identified, said the gunshots sounded like fireworks and they woke her up.

The shooting in North Austin began nearly an hour earlier around 3:50 a.m. when police were asked to respond to an area near the 10600 block of Golden Quail Drive near Kramer Lane. The 911 dispatcher described hearing from a man who sounded distraught and made comments that indicated he may have been suicidal, Manley said.

At 3:57 a.m., officers arrived in the neighborhood looking for the man, Manley said. They found him at his home around 4:10 a.m. with a weapon in his waistband, he said.

Manley said the man, who was described to be in his late 20s, refused to comply with orders from the officers demanding that he disarm. The officers had tried to subdue the man with a stun gun, Manley said, but he retreated into his home. Officers described seeing what appeared to be self-inflicted injuries to his arms, Manley said, which prompted officers to call for medical help.

When the man faced the officers again, Manley said, the officers said they saw the man reach for his weapon. He was shot and killed by the officers. The three officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, Manley said.

Earlier: Three people were killed in overnight shootings including two people shot by Austin police officers, according to preliminary reports.

At the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown at 700 San Jacinto Blvd., authorities said officers shot and killed a suspect who they said fatally wounded a hotel guest. Officials said the shooting happened in the lobby.

As police were interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence, hotel guests at the Omni said they were not allowed to leave the property.

The other shooting happened in North Austin near the 10600 block of Golden Quail Drive, south of Kramer Lane, after police were asked to check on the welfare of an individual. Authorities say that when officers arrived, a man raised a weapon at the officers, who shot and killed him.

Omni Hotel shooter identified as Michael Holt.
Holt rented a desk at Capital Factory, a businesses incubator housed in the same building as the Omni Hotel.
Holt worked in startup community since 2008, including at Austin-based online marketing company RetailMeNot.
Michael Holt, the man Austin police say carried out a fatal shooting at the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown early Sunday before an officer shot and killed him, was an entrepreneur with several ties to local online businesses and the city’s startup community. Austin police officer Carlos Lopez killed Holt Sunday after the 35-year-old suspect pointed a rifle at police. According to a police account of events, Holt — who rented space at a business incubator housed within the same building as the Omni — had shot and killed Conrado Guadalupe Contreras, 60, as well as fired multiple gunshots throughout the hotel lobby earlier that morning.

A Travis County Grand Jury ruled an Austin Police officer was justified in shooting and killing a gunman inside of the Omni Hotel last summer.

All evidence collected from the scene has been released to FOX 7, which shows what police were facing that night.

It was nearly a year ago when a man walked into the lobby with a rifle. He killed one person and could have hurt many more. He was stopped by a police officer who is being hailed a hero.

APD officer cleared of charges in Omni Shooting
""Please send me somebody. There is someone with a gun. He wants to shoot us. Omni downtown,"" 911 call.

Surveillance video shows the gunman running through the Omni hotel dining area with a rifle in hand, then trying to hide from police. Moments later you see APD Officer Carlos Lopez bring the chaotic situation to an end.

""He could have done more harm if he wouldn't have taken him on. He could have gotten up to a floor on the elevator and killed a bunch of people. Thank God we don't know what could have happened, we just know what happened and that is that Officer Lopez is a hero,"" says Det. Ken Casaday, Austin Police Association. 

It was July 5, 2015 when Michael Holt entered the Omni Hotel Downtown around 4:30 in the morning. He had a rifle slung over his shoulder and paid for a room.

Then he visited Capital Factory, which is a business inside of the hotel where Holt was renting desk space.
He cases each room while talking to himself. Then he's seen in the corner of a conference room looking down at the hotel lobby.

When he returns to the front desk, the manager reportedly asks him not to openly carry the rifle. That's when things escalate. You see Holt point his rifle at an employee, this is just minutes before he shoots and kills a cab driver who comes through the front doors.

""A lot of times when you have an active shooter and you know where they're are, we're not trained to sit there and wait. We're trained to take action and eliminate that threat,"" says Casaday.

On Tuesday Officer Lopez was cleared of any charges related to the shooting. His actions and this situation will be used by the police academy in further training for cadets and officers.

""It was the right person at the right time to be in that situation. We're just very blessed and thankful to still have him here and nobody else in that hotel injured,"" says Casaday.

Hamilton County 911 received a call at 11:51 a.m. this morning and were responding to ""unusual behavior, and unusual statements,"" Fletcher said.

Upon arrival, authorities learned that a person inside the residence may be endangering a small child and was armed. Police requested mental health officers, SWAT officers and hostage negotiators to the scene, Fletcher said.

Eagle exited the house several times, Fletcher said, armed with a handgun and a knife. Witnesses in the area heard gunshots come from inside the house, but Fletcher said he doesn't believe anybody was struck by this gunfire.

Eagle exited the house for a final time armed with the handgun, knife and in possession of the small child. Officers started to coax to the child to get them away from Eagle. The child left the possession of Eagle and an officer grabbed the child and put himself in harm's way, Fletcher said.

""One officer could leave cover, placing himself in a very dangerous situation to rescue this small child from the armed suspect,"" Fletcher said.

As the officer was trying to get the child, Eagle moved toward the officer and the child in an aggressive manner, Fletcher said. Multiple officer then fired their weapons, striking Eagle multiple times.

Eagle was transported to Erlanger for treatment, where he later died from his injuries.

Investigators aren't sure if the child was Eagle's. No other information was given about the child other than he or she was a small child.

The Hamilton County Sheriff's Office will be the lead investigator of the incident, as directed by District Attorney General Neal Pinkston. The investigators on scene are conducting a criminal investigation, Fletcher said.

Fletcher also said there will be a heavier police presence in the community tonight, but the public is not in danger.

During a press conference Saturday afternoon, they said they received a call of a man acting strange and that the man may be armed and endangering a small child.

Witnesses told police they heard one gunshot inside the home.

Once police got on scene, they say Javario Eagle came out of the home armed with a handgun, knife and was carrying a small child, refusing to comply with directions from police.

Police say at some point, the child was able to break away from Eagle and run into the hands of an officer.

They say Eagle then moved aggressively towards the officer who had the child and several officers fired their weapon.

Eagle was taken to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

No officers or bystanders were hurt.

SWAT was called in due to a potential hostage situation.

The district attorney's office will not file charges against the six officers who fatally shot a 24-year-old black man in December. 

Hamilton County District Attorney General Neal Pinkston announced today deadly force was justified in the deadly shooting of Javario Eagle on Dec. 12, 2015, at 5113 Woodland View Circle.

During the standoff, the 24-year-old father grabbed a gun and pointed it at an officer, according to a press release. Prior to that, he ignored numerous orders to surrender, the release says. 

""General Pinkston's review is intended to determine whether Chattanooga Police officers performed their duties in a legally justified manner,"" office spokeswoman Melydia Clewell wrote in a statement. ""It does not address compliance with department policies or any issues related to civil liability.""

Officers Lorin Johnston, Allen Griffith, Tim McFarland, Mitchell Moss, Christopher Palmer and Jacques Weary were put on paid leave after the shooting. They were listed in today's press release. 

The Hamilton County Sheriff's Office took over the criminal investigation into Eagle's death immediately and turned their investigative report over to Pinkston's office for a decision on whether or not the shooting was justified. 

Police Chief Fred Fletcher said Wednesday that he has not seen a copy of that investigative report and did not know about Pinkston's decision until the office's press release this morning. 

""The Chief of Police has not received a copy of this investigative report following the completion of General Pinkston's review,"" spokesman Kyle Miller said in a statement. ""The Chief was notified via media reports this morning concerning the General's decision and spoke directly to the General moments ago to request a copy of the report.""

The police department will now conduct an internal administrative review to check whether officers followed department policy during the shooting, Miller added. 

On Dec. 12., Eagle went in and out of the house several times, each time armed, and then left the home a final time with a knife and a handgun, Fletcher said at the time. 

Fletcher said Eagle had a 4-year-old girl with him that final time.

Fletcher said officers tried to coax the girl away from Eagle and an officer left cover to grab the girl once she moved away from her father. At that point, Fletcher said, Eagle ""aggressively moved toward"" the officer and the child, and multiple officers began to shoot.

Pinkston today said that that aggressive movement was Eagle pulling his pistol.

A video of the killing taken by a bystander shows multiple officers surrounding Eagle while bystanders yell at Eagle to put the gun down.

At one point Eagle falls to the ground — the bystander recording the video says, ""They shot him,"" — and then several officers move closer to Eagle.

During a press conference, Pinkston said investigators recovered a bullet that Eagle shot through his apartment roof.

Pinkston also released the sheriff's case file, which he has been reviewing for the last two weeks.

The Times Free Press received a copy of Eagle's 11:51 a.m. call to a 911 dispatcher on Dec. 12, 2015. 

On the phone, Eagle asks about a secret society, says he's going to work, then begins screaming about how ""they're killing our kids.""

When the dispatcher asks who they is, Eagle never answers the question.

A sheriff's deputy shot and killed a Duluth man who was punching her in the head outside a home in east-central Minnesota, authorities said Thursday.

The confrontation occurred in the 500 block of Watkins Street in Mora about 9 p.m. Wednesday, according to the Kanabec County Sheriff's Office.

Thursday afternoon, the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) identified the man as Robert Sullivan Christen, 37, and the deputy as Shanna McIalwain.

A few minutes before the shooting, Christen called 911 and said he ""intended to kill someone"" at the home, according to a statement from BCA, which is investigating the case.

A woman was in the home at the time, BCA spokeswoman Jill Oliveira said. Sheriff Brian Smith said the woman's two children were removed from the residence before the man arrived.

Soon after McIalwain arrived, Christen sped up to the home in a vehicle and crashed into a tree on the front lawn. The deputy exited the front door, and the man ""immediately charged"" at her, the BCA statement said.

She drew her gun and ordered the man to the ground, but ""he ignored the orders and attacked the deputy, repeatedly punching her in the head.""

McIalwain shot and fatally wounded Christen, who was pronounced dead moments later. The Ramsey County medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy and said Christen died of multiple gunshot wounds. McIalwain was treated at the scene for injuries to her forehead and an arm.

As is standard, McIalwain, a 1 ½-year veteran, was placed on administrative leave.

MORA, Minn. (KMSP) - A central Minnesota sheriff’s deputy was repeatedly punched in the head by a suspect, who said he intended to kill someone, then fatally shot him, the Minnesota BCA said.

Kanabec County Deputy Shanna McIalwain responded to a 911 call from a man who said he intended to kill someone at an address on the 500 block of Watkins Street in Mora around 9 p.m. Wednesday.

The BCA said the deputy arrived at the home and the man, identified as 37-year-old Robert Sullivan Christen, arrived, crashing his vehicle into a tree on the front lawn. The deputy emerged from the front door, and he charged at her.

“She drew her weapon and ordered the subject to get on the ground, but he ignored the orders and attacked the deputy, repeatedly punching her in the head. The deputy fired her weapon, striking the subject,” the BCA said.

Investigators have not recovered a weapon from the scene.

The deputy secured the Duluth man with help from an acquaintance of the homeowner, and he was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived. The deputy, who has been placed on standard administrative leave, was treated on-scene for multiple injuries to her forehead and arm. She has been a member of the force for 1 1/2 years.

County Attorney: Deputy was justified in use of deadly force

CORRECTION: The original version of this article incorrectly reported that Deputy McIalwain was suspended following the shooting. This is incorrect. McIalwain was placed on administrative leave following the incident. 

Five months after the fatal shooting of a man by a Kanabec County Sheriff’s Office deputy, the county attorney determined the deputy was justified in her use of deadly force and therefore no criminal charges will be filed against her.

Kanabec County Attorney Barbara McFadden made the determination Feb. 19, shortly after the MN Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) concluded its investigation of the incident. The investigation revealed the man, 37-year-old Robert S. Christen, had a history of mental illness and was under the influence of cocaine at the time of the shooting.

Suicide by cop
On Sept. 30, 2015, at approximately 8:45 p.m. Rob made a 9-1-1 call to report a “possible crime” and stated he was going to kill a person at a home on Watkins Street, Mora where Rob’s girlfriend, Juanita Lietz, and her two children lived.

According to a letter from the county attorney’s office, Deputy Shanna McIalwain was dispatched to the home and spoke with Lietz and another adult who were at the residence. The second adult left with the two children while McIalwain and Lietz stayed at the home to wait for Rob to arrive.

As more detail emerged about Rob’s violent threats from dispatch and from Lietz who had been receiving text messages from Rob, McIalwain called for backup. Moments after, McIalwain saw Rob’s car come flying around the corner, squealing the tires and honking the horn. The car came over the curb and into the yard toward the front of the house stopping as it ran into some bushes.

McIalwain stepped out of the home and was standing on the landing when Rob got out of the car and began to rush toward her. McIalwain drew her handgun and ordered Rob to stop. Instead, he approached her, pushed away her hands and immediately began punching her in the head. After striking her three times, Rob took a temporary step back either by choice or by loss of balance.

McIalwain reported that at that point she was becoming dizzy and felt she was losing consciousness. Out of fear that she could pass out and be beaten to death, shot with her own weapon or the residents of the home harmed, McIalwain fired her weapon at Rob six times, missing with the first shot but striking him five times. When EMTs arrived they provided several minutes of medical care then pronounced Rob dead at the scene.

An autopsy and toxicology screen showed Rob tested positive for both Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC - the active chemical in marijuana) and cocaine.

People who knew Rob told investigators that he had recently been struggling with mental health issues and were worried that his text messages and phone calls were hints at a suicide attempt. “He was very sick,” said Rob’s mother, Pam Christen. “My husband and I basically believe this was suicide by cop.”

In her determination letter McFadden wrote, “... a reasonable person could only conclude that Deputy McIalwain was justified in using deadly force to protect not only her own life, but in all likelihood the lives of both adults and both children who were present at the scene. The events that unfolded ... were the tragic culmination of unmanaged mental illness and illegal drug use.”

A long struggle
Five months after her son’s death, Pam harbors no anger against the police. In fact, she expressed sympathy for McIalwain. “I want it very clear that we hold no ill will against the police officer. She was put in a terrible position and she did what she had to do,” she said.

Rob’s family said he had a long history of mental illness and was receiving treatment. Pam said the events of Sept. 30 show Rob had not been taking his prescribed medication and that he had slipped into a manic episode.

Rob was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was 25 years old. In the 12 years since his diagnosis to his death, Pam said she had seen her son hospitalized 50-60 times, each time only at the peak of a crisis. She said her family was even advised by a social worker for Rob to tell hospitals or the police that he was going to kill himself in order to be admitted.

“It takes a crisis to get any help,” she said. Pam recalled many times that Rob would call the police on himself. Threatening to kill someone or kill himself was the surest way to make sure he was admitted to a hospital.

“When he was not sick, he was a very loving and wonderful person,” said Pam. “He was such a wonderful son.”

Lietz shared a collection of photos that showed the kind and loving side of Rob. Just months before his death, Rob was a groomsman in his friend’s wedding. Pictures also show Rob playing happily with Lietz’s family at Paul Bunyan Land and with his favorite dog, Casper.

But his constant struggles with mental illness took their toll. “He just didn’t want to be sick anymore,” said Lietz.

A tragic end
“It was a tragic event that ended terribly,” said Kanabec County Sheriff Brian Smith. “(Deputy McIalwain) did her duty. She completed her oath and stood her ground to protect somebody that she thought needed protecting and I commend her for that. She was in a scary situation and she did what she had to do. Unfortunately, somebody forced her to do something that none of us want to do.”

Smith said jails and law enforcement are seeing more and more incidents of crime connected to mental illness that could be prevented with earlier intervention. Smith said the resources to help those with mental illness just

aren’t in place which puts the burden on medical hospitals and law enforcement, both which are not as well equipped to handle issues of mental health.

“We need to get people the help they need and jails are not the place for that,” he said.

Pam shared a similar view of the mental health system. “The mental health system is doing the best they can with a flood of patients,” she said. “The system is overwhelmed and I don’t know what will fix it.”

Pam said Rob, the police officers who he had been in contact with and his care workers did the best they knew how.

“I think everyone does the best they can,” she said. “The thing that gives me the most peace is that I know Rob is in a better place and that he is not suffering anymore.”

Deputy McIalwain was placed on administrative leave following the shooting, but returned to active duty two weeks later. She declined to be interviewed for this article.

Baltimore County police said an officer shot a man that charged at him carrying knives Monday morning.
Baltimore County police fatally shot a man Monday after responding to his Bowleys Quarters home for a report of an attempted suicide.

Police said the man, whose name has not been released, grabbed kitchen knives from a drawer and advanced on the officers after they had tried to subdue him with a Taser.

The man's girlfriend had called 911 about 9:48 a.m. after he had taken a large number of pills, police said. Both police and fire personnel were dispatched to the home in the 4000 block of Bay Drive.

It was the fifth fatal shooting by county police this year, compared to two last year.

It was the second time in the past three weeks in which county police have shot a person they said was suicidal. On Nov. 24, an officer shot a man in the wrist on the Wise Avenue drawbridge in Dundalk, after police said he swung a knife at them.

 Police shoot Middle River man holding knives
In the incident Monday, officers who responded to the scene encountered the woman who had called 911 at the front door and found the man inside, said Cpl. John Wachter, a police spokesman.

The officers ""attempted to talk him into going to the hospital on his own,"" but he refused, Wachter said.

""He was refusing to go, so they were going to have to force him to go,"" Wachter said.

They tried to use at least one Taser to bring the man ""under control,"" but that did not help, he said.

After the man took several knives from a kitchen drawer, the officers again deployed a Taser, but it ""was ineffective,"" Wachter said. Three officers then opened fire.

Homicide detectives are investigating, which is standard procedure in police shootings. The names of the officers involved were not released. The department said they would be placed on administrative status.

Several neighbors in the waterfront community said they did not hear gunshots and that they did not know much about the man who was killed.

George Clavell, 72, said he saw paramedics approach the home before the shooting when he was leaving his home to take his wife to the doctor, but emergency vehicles didn't have their lights on, and he didn't think much of it.

""It didn't seem like it was an emergency call,"" said Clavell, a retired county firefighter.

A recent report by the Virginia-based nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center found that people with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely than others to be killed during police encounters.

""This kind of scenario plays out all too often,"" said Ron Honberg, legal director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

Crisis-intervention training can help teach officers to de-escalate the situation, he said.

""Police have become the frontline responders to people in crisis,"" he said.

MIDDLE RIVER, Md. –  Police in Maryland say a man was shot to death after he grabbed knives from a kitchen drawer and moved toward officers.

Baltimore County police Cpl. John Wachter says officers and paramedics were called to a home in Middle River, east of Baltimore, on Monday after a 911 caller reported that a man tried to kill himself. Wachter says police tried to persuade the man to go to a hospital, but he refused.

SHAFTER, Calif. (KBAK/KBFX) -- Some neighbors in this community are raising questions after Shafter police shot and killed a man allegedly armed with a knife.

Rodolfo Velazquez, 47, has been identified as the man shot by three officers in an alley near Golden Oak Elementary School. The Kern County District Attorney's office will handle the shooting investigation.

In the meantime, neighbors and relatives have concerns.

""I only saw the police coming around,"" Esparanza Medina told Eyewitness News on Friday. She identified herself as Velazquez' mother-in-law, and said she had heard the gunshots fired on Thursday, and saw him fall to the ground in the alley.

Medina added in Spanish, that Velazquez was a really nice person, but he was in a bad state of mind, since he was separated from his son. She said her daughter didn't want Velazquez to see the 5-year-old boy.

Medina said she didn't know if he was on drugs Thursday, but a neighbor said he'd spotted the man talking to himself and pacing through the alley earlier in the morning.

Shafter Police had reported they got a call of a man acting erratically, possibly under the influence of drugs, and carrying a knife. Deputy Police Chief Brian Smith said officers ordered Velazquez to drop the knife, but he still came at them with it.

""Fearing for their lives, the officers fired at the suspect, causing fatal injuries,"" Smith had said on Thursday.

""They have Tasers,"" Shafter resident Eduardo Tellez complained, standing in the alley where Velazquez was shot. He thinks the officers could have used stun guns to subdue a man who was reportedly armed with a knife.

Eyewitness News contacted Chief Smith, and he said Shafter officers do have stun guns, but he could not comment on their use.

Kern County Assistant District Attorney Scott Spielman said, as with many smaller law enforcement agencies, his office will do the criminal investigation into this shooting. Spielman says they'll review interviews, evidence. and reports -- including the coroner's report. He said this process can take several weeks, or could be even more lengthy.

Spielman said the review will be sent to him for a determination on whether criminal charges are appropriate. The D.A.'s office will also send their finished report to the police chief, so that department can complete their administrative investigation.

Medina said the family is surprised at what happened. She said Velazquez had lived in her home for five years, and he was nice to everyone.

The scene of the shooting is close to Golden Oak Elementary, and school district officials told Eyewitness News the campus was put on lock-down during the incident, and that was then lifted when Shafter Police gave the all-clear.

Shafter PD said the three officers who fired their weapons were Sgt. Gustavo Olvera, Sr. Officer Alecio Mora, and Officer Anthony Erwin. They have all been put on leave.

Deputy Chief Brian Smith said that's difficult for the department, because they currently have a staff of 22 officers. The chief also told Eyewitness News the last time Shafter had an officer-involved shooting was in 2012. He said there were two that year, one was fatal and the other resulted in injuries.

Asked if the officers felt threatened when they shot at the suspect on Thursday, Smith said -- according to their statements, yes.

But, neighbors like Eduardo Tellez have questions.

""I feel it was like cowardly,"" Tellez said, about the officers' actions. ""That three, big guys would use that strategy, or like that tactic, to take down a man.""",Yes,No,,No,,http://static-40.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/be423a0a-c5ae-46c4-bdb3-e4bc4a612a99-150420shafterpoliceshooting.jpg?1447800703181,Yes,http://www.bakersfield.com/news/2016/02/02/da-fatal-shooting-by-shafter-police-justified.html,DA: Fatal shooting by Shafter Police justified,"DA: Fatal shooting by Shafter Police justified

A fatal shooting in April involving the Shafter Police Department was found to be justified by the Kern County District Attorney’s Office, it announced Tuesday.

The DA concluded that the use of lethal force against Rodolfo Velazquez was justified under all the circumstances, which included his violent and unpredictable behavior.

On April 16, Shafter Senior Officer Alecio Mora received a report that Velazquez, 47, may have been using methamphetamine, according to a news release from the DA. Velazquez’s family said he was agitated, sweating profusely, hallucinating and paranoid.

While Mora was explaining the situation with Velazquez to Sgt. Gustavo Olvera, Velazquez’s family received a phone call telling them he was outside his apartment and “the police need to act immediately,” according to the release. Shortly before 12:30 p.m., Mora and Olvera found Velazquez in the south alley of the 100 block of W. Lerdo Highway.

Velazquez was armed with a large knife and grabbed a plastic basketball hoop base to use as a shield, the DA’s office reported. It was then that Velazquez moved toward the officers, who tried multiple times to calm him down.

When he got about eight feet from the officers he raised his knife, the release said. Mora and Olvera then fired their handguns at Velazquez and he died at the scene.

An autopsy found Velazquez was shot four times and died from his wounds, the DA report said. A toxicology report found a high level of meth in his system.

In July of last year, the DA office announced it would investigate all officer-related shootings resulting in death for all local law enforcement agencies.

The name of the man shot to death by police after he raised a gun at a police helicopter and two officers Saturday is Robert Elando Malone, 42. Malone was shot and killed at SE 51 and Dimple Drive Saturday afternoon. The officers who fired at Malone were Sgt. Edward D. Mosier, a 12-year veteran and Sgt. Joey Laughead, who has been a police officer 13 years.

A man who aimed a handgun at a police helicopter and at two officers was shot and killed by the officers on the ground Saturday in southeast Oklahoma City, police Capt. Paco Balderrama said.

About 3:15 p.m., officers were looking for a man who was armed and had tried to break into vehicles at an apartment complex in the 4200 block of SE 54, when a neighbor saw the man fleeing and pointed him out to the officers, Balderrama said.

A police helicopter crew spotted him and flew above him as he ran on north on Dimple Drive. As two officers on the ground pursued, the man aimed a handgun at the helicopter then aimed it at the officers on the ground.

Deadly officer involved shooting
h
OKLAHOMA CITY-- Oklahoma City Police are investigating a fatal officer involved shooting in southeast Oklahoma City.

It happened at SE 51st and Dimple.

Residents in the neighborhood say they heard the shots.

""I heard probably like 10 to 12 gun shots and came outside and saw the officer kneeling down with his weapon drawn,"" Presten McCalip said.

""Sounded like fireworks. I told her that's not fireworks. So I came out and that's when I saw the police officer he was down on his knee like that,"" Wayne Calton said.

Police say a middle-aged black male is dead after two officers fired at him.

""They obviously responded to their training and they are okay this evening,"" Capt. Paco Balderrama said.

Police say it started with a disturbance call at a nearby apartment complex in the 4200 block of SE 54th.

""It was a man with a gun but the information on the call stated that the suspect was just walking around and obviously had a firearm but was checking cars as if he was trying to steal one,"" Capt. Balderrama said.

Officers along with a helicopter searched for the suspect.

Once they found him police say he ran.

""At that point in time the suspect actually raised the weapon at the helicopter. The officers on the ground fired at the suspect. The suspect then lowered his firearm and pointed at the officers on the scene,"" Capt. Balderrama said.

""You can really do nothing towards the police. The guy's deceased and it really sucks for his family and I feel sorry for him,"" McCalip said.

The officers were not hurt, but have been placed on administrative leave.<

The suspect's identify has not been released.

ORDER REPRINT OF THIS STORY
One person was shot and killed by Dallas police as officers chased a person they believed was involved in a phony check scheme at a Gaston County grocery store.

The shooting happened about 3 p.m. Tuesday on U.S. 321 in Gaston County near the Dallas-Cherryville exit. Officers haven’t released the name or any other information about the person who was killed or the officers involved in the chase and shooting. None of the officers involved was seriously injured.

Police were called out to the Ingles grocery store regarding a bogus check scheme, said Dallas police Chief Gary Buckner. Officers had been called to the store for similar problems in the past, Buckner said.

Officers arrived and arrested two people, Buckner said. They were identified as Odell Dewayne Lloyd Jr. and Eric Darnell White, according to WBTV, the Observer’s media partner.

Police said an Ingles employee recognized Lloyd from fraudulent checks passed in November.

Lloyd, 43, of Charlotte, was in the Gaston County Jail on $5,145 bail Wednesday. He is charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretense and obtaining property by false pretense. He has a court hearing at 2 p.m. Wednesday, jail records show.

White, 59, of Charlotte, is free on $2,000 bail.

Police said another person sped away in what appeared to be a gray or silver 1990s model Ford Crown Victoria. Dallas police officers gave chase on nearby U.S. 321.

At one point, the officers were able to force the car to stop. But Buckner said the driver accelerated toward the officers, striking a patrol car. At least one officer discharged his weapon.

“As officers approached the suspect vehicle, the suspect struck two patrol vehicles and officers fired shots,” he said.

Buckner said he couldn’t disclose the number of officers who fired shots.

The suspect, apparently struck and wounded, sped away, and officers continued to pursue. But about a mile away from the site of the shooting, the suspect crashed.

Officers approached the vehicle for a second time and saw the suspect unresponsive inside. They removed the suspect from the car and rendered medical aid. The suspect was later pronounced dead at the scene.

Buckner didn’t reveal details about the investigation, which has been taken over by the State Bureau of Investigation. Ultimately, authorities will have to determine whether the officer was justified in using deadly force, Buckner said.

“A vehicle is considered a deadly weapon by North Carolina statute,” he said. “That’s part of the investigation that the SBI is conducting.”

The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave as criminal and internal investigations continue.

Police weren’t looking for any other suspects in connection with the check scheme. “We don’t believe that anyone else was involved in this,” Buckner said. “We believe everyone else was accounted for.”

“Please bear with us and the State Bureau of Investigation,” Buckner admonished the public. “All of this is going to be investigated in great detail.”

Buckner asked anyone who observed the police activity at Ingles on Hardin Road to contact police or the SBI.

Charlotte man identified in officer-involved shooting

By Lauren Baheri
Gazette staff 

Officials say a Charlotte man was killed by bullets from a Dallas police officer’s gun.

The man led officers on a chase, ran his car into a patrol car then drove toward an officer before that officer fired, according to a spokeswoman with the State Bureau of Investigation.

Ronnie Dubose Carr, 51, of Charlotte died from the gunshot wounds after crashing his car a second time.

SBI: Suspect drove car at officer: According to police, the incident started at Ingles grocery store in Dallas Tuesday around noon.

An employee told police two men were attempting to cash fake checks. Two Dallas officers arrested the men, Odell Lloyd Jr., 43, and Eric Darnell White, 59.

While the two men were being arrested, Capt. Robert Scott noticed a car, which police said was connected to similar crimes, leaving the parking lot.

Scott attempted to stop the car, but the driver fled, SBI spokeswoman Audria Bridges said.

Two other Dallas officers, Sgt. Paul Albergine and Officer Matt Scott, assisted in the chase that led onto U.S. 321. Carr eventually crashed near Hardin Road.

Officers left their vehicles to surround Carr when he drove into one of the patrol cars. Bridges says Carr then drove toward where Albergine was standing, and Albergine fired his gun.

Carr drove away and later wrecked again a mile north on U.S. 321.

He was found unresponsive and pronounced dead on the scene.

Gunshots a cause of death: According to Bridges, officials found a weapon inside Carr’s vehicle.

Carr died from multiple gunshot wounds, Bridges said. Officials still have not said exactly how many shots Albergine fired.

All three officers — Capt. Scott, Sgt. Albergine and officer Scott — were placed on paid administrative leave.

Police are still waiting on preliminary autopsy and toxicology reports for Carr.

Dallas Police Chief Gary Buckner said dash cam video from the shooting that has been turned over to the SBI.

The SBI is investigating and will consult with Gaston County District Attorney Locke Bell when the report is complete.

A criminal past: Carr has a history of criminal activity in the Charlotte area, though Bridges said he had no known ties to Dallas.

His criminal history includes convictions of worthless checks and forgery. He has also been charged in Charlotte with assault with a deadly weapon with intent kill and more charges of forgery.

He was also wanted on federal charges, but details of that case were unclear.

Bridges says investigators are still trying to get in touch with Carr’s family. Any relatives are asked to call the SBI at 704-454-5264.

EATON RAPIDS TWP., MI - A man who was killed in a police involved shooting Tuesday morning has been identified as 32-year-old Matthew Lundy of Charlotte.

Lundy was armed when police approached him at about 7:30 a.m. Feb. 17 while responding to a call involving a vehicle in the ditch on Canfield Road in Eaton Rapids Township, a statement from the Michigan State Police said.

Michigan State police Detective First Lt. Sean Furlong said two deputies from the Eaton County Sheriff's Office responded to the initial call and arrived at the scene in the same vehicle.

CHARLOTTE – Eaton County Prosecutor Doug Lloyd said no charges will be brought against three deputies involved in the fatal shooting of a 32-year-old Charlotte man in February.

Matthew Lundy was shot Feb. 17 by Eaton County Sheriff's deputies after his sport-utility vehicle went into a ditch and became stuck in a snow bank along Canfield Road in Eaton Rapids Township.

Lundy, a convicted felon, had a gun. He was shot 10 times, according to Lloyd and Michigan State Police, who investigated the incident. Three deputies were at the scene, and two of them fired their weapons, Lloyd confirmed at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon. A total of 11 shots were fired.

Lundy's weapon - a derringer-style pistol - was not discharged, but Lloyd said audio recordings at the scene and marks on bullets in Lundy's gun indicate that he may have tried to fire it at officers before he died.

After seeing the gun and Lundy's arm raised toward his partner, Deputy Tad Schwartz fired nine rounds from his service weapon. Minutes later, after deputies heard a ""click"" that sounded like a gun trigger, Deputy Theresa VanDorpe fired two more rounds with a rifle, Lloyd said.





Body camera footage of February shooting involving Eaton County Sheriff's Deputies Video by Dave Wasinger/Lansing State Journal

Lundy had experienced turmoil over the previous few days, Lloyd said, and had threatened suicide or suggested he might spark a confrontation with police that would end his life. His relationship with his girlfriend was in jeopardy and he was facing a probation violation hearing after being charged with retail fraud, Lloyd said.

Lundy sent text messages that he would die before going back to jail and that his life was over, the prosecutor said.

Lloyd said he treated the incident, which lasted a total of about eight minutes, as two separate shootings. Schwartz fired after Lundy raised his gun and pointed it at Deputy Chris Cunningham, he said.

The first shot from VanDorpe came after deputies heard what sounded like a trigger click. The second came as a school bus approached them on Canfield, and VanDorpe believed Lundy was trying to get into position to fire his gun, Lloyd said.

""From Deputy VanDorpe, what I saw was her in a situation where not only did you have Mr. Lundy moving, Mr. Lundy not complying with orders (and) an actual click of a gun, you also had a school bus come into the area as well,"" Lloyd said. ""Those two shots were justifiable.""

Lloyd said he spoke with Lundy's family before announcing his decision.

""They lost a son, they lost a brother,"" he said. ""Obviously, that's hard. (But) they were glad we were able to meet.""

An attorney for Lundy's estate said family members are satisfied that the incident was thoroughly investigated.

""At this time, the Lundy Estate will not be seeking any further action of any sort against the officers involved in this incident,"" the attorney, Jamie White, said in a prepared statement.

Eaton County Undersheriff Jeff Cook said Schwartz and VanDorpe, who initially were placed on paid leave, have been on administrative duty for about a month and will be returned to full duty.

The Feb. 17 incident was the first of two fatal roadside shootings involving Eaton County Sheriff's Office personnel in less than two weeks.

On Feb. 28, a sheriff's sergeant shot and killed Deven Guilford, 17, of Mulliken, after a traffic stop on M-43, west of Cochran Road, in Roxand Township.

Officials said Guilford was shot after he and Sgt. Jonathan Frost became involved in a physical struggle. Guilford died at the scene. Frost was hospitalized for undisclosed injuries after the incident.

The state police investigation into that incident is still ongoing, officials said.

Around 3:30 p.m. Sunday, Anaheim Police were asked by family members to check on Monique Jenee Deckard because she had been acting strangely and they could not locate her. A little more than two hours later, the 43-year-old was dead from Anaheim's first officer-involved shooting of 2015.

Friends of family members had told dispatchers that Deckard ""had a history of instability"" and was trying to buy a firearm, but when officers went to her apartment in the 900 block of South Roberts Street, they could not find her, says Lt. Bob Dunn, the Anaheim Police spokesman.

Then, at 5:30 p.m., a stabbing was reported at a laundromat in the 900 block of South Euclid Street, where a female with a knife attacked a female laundromat patron, says Dunn, who adds the lady armed with the knife fled the business with officers on the way.

Area residents and business owners knew the woman and directed cops to Deckard's apartment, where she lives alone, but on the other side of her closed front door she refused to come out to speak with officers, Dunn said.

Before an Anaheim Police negotiator arrived on scene, Deckard emerged from the apartment armed with two knives and charged officers who were in the apartment complex courtyard, Dunn said.

""Several"" officers were involved in the shooting where Deckard was struck by gunfire, treated by paramedics and taken to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival, Dunn said.

No officers were injured, and the woman at the laundromat, who was stabbed in the back, did not suffer life-threatening injuries, Dunn said.

The spokesman noted that many officers involved in the incident were equipped with body cameras and that the footage from them will be turned over to the Orange County District Attorney's office, which is investigating the officer-involved shooting.

SANTA CLARA -- A Tracy man has been identified as the person shot and killed Sunday by two Santa Clara police officers during an attempted convenience store robbery.

Devin James Gates, 24 walked into a 7-Eleven at 2105 Scott Blvd. around 2 a.m. Sunday, according to Lt. Kurt Clarke. Gates then pointed a gun at the clerk, attempting to rob the store, Clarke said.

Officers Josh Craig, a 5-year veteran and Randy Van Diemen, a 2-year veteran, responded to a call about a robbery in progress at the 7-Eleven, Clarke said. When they got to the store, they saw Gates who shot once at the clerk but missed.

Clarke said Gates then left the store, where he was confronted by the two officers. Gates refused to comply with officers' orders, and fearing for their lives and for other citizens in the parking lot, the officers opened fire, killing him, Clarke said.

A loaded firearm and money taken from the 7-Eleven were found next to the 24-year-old, Clarke added.

No one else was injured.

Craig and Van Diemen have been placed on paid administrative leave, a standard procedure during an officer-involved shooting investigation.

This is the second shooting of the year involving Santa Clara police officers. On Feb. 9, an auto burglary suspect tried to ram a Santa Clara police officer against his patrol car, causing the officer to open fire, police said. The man escaped the scene, but was arrested when he showed up at a San Francisco hospital with gunshot wounds the next day.

A robbery suspect shot and killed by Santa Clara police moments after he fired a shot at a convenience store clerk was identified Tuesday as 24-year-old Devin James Gates of Tracy.
Santa Clara police also identified the two officers involved as Joshua Craig — who shot and killed a suspect in 2012 — and Randy Van Diemen.
The incident happened about 2 a.m. Sunday, when Craig and Van Diemen arrived in separate marked vehicles at the 7-Eleven store at 2105 Scott Blvd. and came across a robbery in progress, said police Lt. Kurt Clarke.
The officers were in the parking lot when the suspect pointed a gun at the clerk and fired a shot, Clarke said.
“I’m getting shots fired,” one of the officers said on the radio. The suspect came out of the store, where he was confronted by the officers, police said.
The man “did not comply with the officers’ commands,” Clarke said. “Fearing for their lives and safety of citizens in the parking lot, the officers discharged their firearms, fatally wounding the suspect.”
A loaded revolver and money taken from the store were found next to the suspect, Clarke said. The store clerk and the officers weren’t injured.
Craig and Van Diemen have been placed on paid administrative leave, a routine step, pending investigations by police and the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office.
The incident was the third shooting by Bay Area officers within eight hours.
In 2012, Craig shot and killed Jose de Jesus Nunez Ramirez, 42, of Santa Clara after the man allegedly reached for a .38-caliber revolver during a drunken-driving stop on the 2400 block of Karen Drive just east of San Tomas Expressway.

SANTA CLARA -- The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office has cleared two city of Santa Clara police officers in the fatal 2015 shooting of a Tracy man they reportedly saw rob a convenience store and fire a gun a clerk.

Around 2 a.m. on March 22, Devin Gates, 24, donned a ski mask and used a large revolver to rob the 7-Eleven at 2105 Scott Blvd., according to a report released Thursday. Gates reportedly told the clerk he would shoot him if he didn't give him money.

According to the report, the clerk handed over a $20 bill, but it wasn't enough for Gates, who yelled ""Give me all of it!"" and fired a single round into the floor. Fearing for his life, the clerk stuffed more money into a brown paper bag Gates was holding.

Meanwhile, officers Josh Craig and Randy Van Diemen has just pulled into the parking lot of the 7-Eleven -- Craig to use the restroom and Van Diemen to talk with Craig -- and witnessed both the robbery and the shooting, according to the report.

Gates emerged from the convenience store, looked at the officers and ran toward a row of parked cars. The officers opened fire -- Craig with an AR-15 and Van Diemen with a Glock 21 -- when Gates ignored their commands to stop, according to the report.

""Gates posed a significant threat to their lives and the lives of others,"" said Deputy District Attorney Carolyn Powell. ""Recognizing this immediate safety risk and intending to impede Gates from causing more harm or escaping, the officers had no other means by which they could neutralize the threat than to discharge their weapons.""

Three rounds hit Gates, according to the report. An occupied pick-up truck also was struck twice. A total of five .223 casings and three .45 rounds were collected at the scene.

Emergency medical personnel pronounced Gates deceased at the scene. A Colt Trooper Mk III .357 Magnum and a bag containing $345 were reportedly found near his body.

According to the report, Gates had cocaine and marijuana in his system at the time of his death. The report also detailed Gates' criminal history, which involved a conviction for possession of a controlled substance, and he was identified as the primary suspect in a similar armed robbery at a Tracy convenience store five days earlier.

Brittany Schuyler, Gates' girlfriend, was waiting in the driver's seat of a rental car outside the 7-Eleven. Schuyler reportedly said the couple was returning to Tracy after visiting family in Santa Clara and claimed to know nothing of Gates' plans to rob the convenience store.

According to the report, Schuyler told police Gates would've shot the officers if they hadn't shot him first.

""He would kill anyone that tried to put his life in danger,"" she said. ""He hates the police.""

A sheriff's helicopter comes in for a landing at the scene of an officer-involved shooting that left a man dead in Moreno Valley on Thursday, July 16, 2015.
PETER SUROWSKI, STAFF
A Moreno Valley man who was shot to death by sheriff’s deputies after assaulting three other people a week ago was identified on Thursday.
Anthonie Smith, 25, was shot at 6:03 a.m. July 16 in the roadway in the 24900 block of Sunnymead Boulevard, according to a coroner’s report released in response to inquiries by The Press-Enterprise.
The names of the deputies involved have not been released. Sgt. Mike Manning said a “threat assessment” was still being conducted to determine if they would be made public.
He could not release their race, but said Smith was African American.
Moreno Valley has a system of more than 250 surveillance cameras, many placed at intersections and parks around the city, which are monitored by the Sheriff’s Department. Manning said if any cameras captured the shooting, the footage would not be made public because it would be part of an investigation.
About 3 a.m. July 16, Smith’s parents called police to say he had just physically assaulted a juvenile relative, and that he had a history of mental illness, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department said in a news release.
Deputies found Smith in a bedroom of a home on Fir Street east of Perris Boulevard. He attacked a deputy with a “large metal hand tool,” causing serious injury, authorities said. He jumped out a second-story window and escaped.
Three hours later, he stabbed a man nearby, causing non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said.
Two deputies found Smith near Perris and Sunnymead boulevards. They said despite their pleas that he surrender, he refused to put down objects in his hands – later determined to be a knife and a hand tool – and advanced on the deputies, causing at least one of them to shoot.
A Taser that deputies attempted to use during both encounters with Smith had no effect, a sheriff’s statement said. It was unclear why.
Smith’s criminal record included a 2010 conviction for misdemeanor resisting or obstructing a public officer, court records show.

Cellphone video provided to KTLA on Thursday showed the final moments of a deadly confrontation between Moreno Valley police and a man accused of attacking an officer hours earlier.

Cellphone video captured the moment when the man was fatally shot by authorities on July 16, 2015. 
Cellphone video captured the moment when the man was fatally shot by authorities on July 16, 2015.
The incident began about 3 a.m. Thursday when officers with the Moreno Valley Police Department responded to a call from a parent reporting a mentally ill man assaulting a family member in the 25000 block of Fir Avenue, said Deputy Michael Vasquez, a spokesman for the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.

As officers attempted to talk to the man, he attacked one of them with a large metal hand tool, a news release from the Sheriff's Department stated.

The injured officer was transported to the hospital with injuries that were described as moderate.

“When officers arrived, the suspect attacked one of the responding officers and fled the location,"" Vasquez said.

The suspect escaped by jumping from a second-floor window and disappeared, the release stated.

Then, at around 6 a.m., law enforcement responded to a report of a stabbing in the area of Webster Avenue and Perris Boulevard, which is located roughly a quarter-mile away from the initial incident, according to the deputy.

Officers found the stabbing victim -- who had moderate wounds -- and called an ambulance. His condition was not provided by Vasquez.

Within minutes, authorities located someone they identified as a ""suspect"" at Perris and Sunnymeade boulevards, according to the spokesman.

“The suspect was holding an unknown object at that time and refused to drop the item, and advanced on officers,” Vasquez said.

At that point, an ""officer-involved shooting"" occurred, according to Vasquez.

""The officers identified the suspect in the stabbing as the same individual who was involved in the officer-involved assault hours prior,"" he added.

Exclusive cellphone video from the scene obtained by KTLA showed the moment when police opened fire.

""Whatever he had in his hand ... he shoved it at the police officers,"" the woman who shot the video told KTLA.

It was unclear whether the man was advancing on the two officers prior to where the cellphone video began recording. Moments before the fatal shot was fired, however, the man can be seen getting up from the ground.

""The first couple of rounds were just kind of random,"" said the witness, who wished to remain anonymous. ""When he went down the first time, he seemed to get right back up.""

A tool -- possibly a wrench or pliers -- was found not far from the victim's body. (Credit: Casper News)

The footage then showed the man appearing to back away from law enforcement personnel before being shot at least once.

""The officers just repeatedly kept saying, 'please lower your weapon, we will be forced to shoot,'"" the witness said. ""They did what they could be avoid the situation.""

The man was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Vasquez. His identity has yet to be released.

It was not immediately known how many times the man was hit by gunfire.

It was later determined that he had a knife and a hand tool in his hands, according to the release.

Video shot by a photojournalist at the scene showed a tool -- possibly a wrench or pliers -- in the middle of the roadway, which was where the man was shot. It was unknown if that was the object he was allegedly holding during the confrontation with police.

During both contacts with the man, officers attempted to use a Taser, but it had no effect on him, authorities stated.

No officers were injured in the shooting, which was under investigation.

The officers involved in the shooting were assigned to the Moreno Valley Police Department, which is contracted by the county Sheriff's Department, according to sheriff's Sgt. Mike Manning.

The officers were placed on administrative leave. Their names were not released.

Anyone with information about any of the incidents has been asked to contact the Moreno Valley Police Department at 951-247-8700.

The MPD officer stopped a car for a broken headlight in the 5700 block of Winchester Road. The officer issued the driver a ticket and let him go. However, the passenger in the car had several warrants for his arrest.

Darrius Stewart, the 19-year-old passenger, was placed in the back seat of the police car to verify the warrants. 

Investigators said when the officer opened the back door to handcuff Stewart, he kicked the door and attacked the officer. During the fight, Stewart grabbed the officer’s handcuffs and swung them at him. The officer grabbed his gun and shot Stewart to end the fight.

Stewart went to Regional Medical Center in critical condition where he later died.

The officer had several cuts and bruises from the fight, but he did not need to go to the hospital. He is relieved of duty pending the outcome of this investigation.

""Words can't express how I feel,"" Stewart's mother said. ""If my son attacked this officer, why didn't he use a taser? There were two officers and only one of my son.""

Family members said they want answers. They said police gave them no information about what happened to their son, but they said he did not have any warrants like police claim.

Stewart's mother said her son was detained several months ago for the same thing.

""They told him he could leave because he wasn't the one they were looking for, but to be safe, because there is someone out there with the same name and a lot of warrants,"" she said.

Police said Stewart had a warrant in Iowa that was believed to be for a sex offense and another warrant in Illinois. When asked why Stewart was not handcuffed, police said they do not have a policy about handcuffing people in the car.

Stewart's mother said her son was going to attend the University of Memphis in the fall. He planned to become a doctor, and he has never been arrested.

Police said they could not provide answers about the warrants at this time.

""We don't understand,"" aunt Terry Stewart said. ""Police are supposed to serve and protect, yet society fears. I think they are hiding a lot of things.""

Memphis Police said they do not know for sure if the warrants were Stewart's. They said they were able to access his name and birth date and find warrants, but were not able to access pictures from other agencies.

Ministers press DA for update on Stewart case
TBI file: 'He seemed like he was going to give me no problems,' officer says
By Jody Callahan

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation will lead the inquiry into the fatal shooting by a Memphis police officer after a traffic stop Friday night, officials said Monday.



Darrius Stewart, 19, was shot and killed a little before midnight after the officer pulled over the car he was riding in near 5799 Winchester.

Memphis police won’t identify the officer involved but said during a press conference Monday afternoon that he is white. Stewart was black. When asked the officer’s name, Memphis police said the information would have to come from the TBI. However, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said  his agency would not be releasing the officer's name.

“I’m aware this incident is on the forefront of media coverage, and I’m equally aware of the national sentiment and the appearance of this shooting. A Caucasian police officer shoots and kills an African-American male. We all know of the examples that have occurred in the last year from Ferguson to Baltimore, and the climate that we now live in must be taken into account,” Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong said at the press conference.

“We are going to be transparent and to get to the bottom of what happened and why it happened,” Armstrong added. “There are questions that must be answered, and as a law enforcement agency, we have a responsibility to make sure that those questions are answered, and that all concerns are properly addressed.”

According to police, the officer pulled over a blue 2009 Chevrolet Malibu for a headlight problem. The officer put Stewart in the back of the squad car without handcuffs, police said, while he tried to verify that Stewart was the subject of two active warrants.

Shortly after verifying the warrants, police said, the officer reported by radio that the suspect had been shot and requested an ambulance.

According to police, the officer opened the door to handcuff Stewart. Police said Stewart then kicked the door and attacked the officer, using the handcuffs to strike him. Police said the officer then pulled his weapon and fired. Stewart was transported to the Regional Medical Center in critical condition, but later was pronounced dead.

Both Armstrong and Shelby County Dist. Atty. Gen. Amy Weirich said at the press conference that they want the investigation to be “open and transparent.”

“If and when the time comes when all of the information can be shared with the community, we will do that,” Weirich said.

Although Memphis police records are public, TBI reports are sealed by state law.

Darrius Stewart's father reacts to grand jury's decision
Weirich said she asked the grand jury to indict Officer Schilling on charges of voluntary manslaughter after she reviewed the 800 page report completed by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

""My recommendation was the Grand Jury indict Officer Schilling for voluntary manslaughter and for employment of a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony,"" Weirich announced. ""In accordance with its statutory authority, however, the grand jury has chosen not to indict Officer Schilling on either charge. Thus, there can be no criminal prosecution in the case.""

Stewart was killed during a July 2015 traffic stop on Winchester Road.

Weirich said when Officer Schilling discovered Stewart had two outstanding warrants for his arrest in other states, he attempted to place him under arrest. That is when Stewart attacked Officer Schilling, resisted arrest, and hit the officer with his own handcuffs. 

""Officer Schilling said during the struggle, he fired his service weapon at Stewart, killing him,"" Weirich said. ""The medical examiner's report shows Stewart died of two gunshots wounds.""

A few minutes after Weirich's announcement, NAACP leaders held their own news conference. 

NAACP leaders said they were not happy about the decision and would continue to seek justice.

""I ask the people to remain calm and peaceful. I ask people not to take matters in their own hands,"" NAACP branch president Pastor Keith Norman said. 

Norman joined other NAACP members who said they wanted people to remain peaceful. They emphasized that being peaceful did not mean giving up on the search for justice. They said they were on their way to meet with Weirich to discuss their reactions and disappointment with the announcement.

They said there were still civil actions which could be taken, but encouraged others to remember where the incident began.

""By the time we get to the end, we've forgotten how it started. This was a traffic stop and a young man is dead,"" Norman said.

Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong said a coalition would be formed to address criminal justice reform and educate the public on the legal processes surrounding investigations.

""We have all agreed we need to do a better job at educating the public,"" Armstrong said. ""We have agreed that going forward, there will be a coalition that clearly identifies, clearly defines, what that [criminal justice reform] looks like, and we will address the legislators in Nashville as it relates to that.""

Additionally, Armstrong said the process was not completely over for Officer Schilling. 

""The grand jury has spoken as it relates to what happened. The next steps, as it relates to Officer Schilling: he remains off duty, non-enforcement. We will have an administrative hearing next week. At the conclusion of that hearing, I will come back and let you know what the outcome of that hearing is,"" Armstrong said.

Legal counsel representatives for the family spoke to media and said the family was still grieving, but they would not give up on seeking justice. However, they said they were encouraged that District Attorney Weirich recommended an indictment.

""The members of the Stewart family and the Williams family are devastated. In our wildest imagination, we never expected that the grand jury would return a no true bill or no indictment,"" family attorney Carlos Moore said. ""We were encouraged by the fact that the district attorney did present evidence of the TBI report to the grand jury, and we believe she got it right in seeking a manslaughter charge. We don't know how any reasonable grand jurors could have come back with a no indictment."" 

Moore said the legal team is making a demand for the Department of Justice to look into the case and investigation. Moore said the legal team was disappointed Schilling was not immediately arrested once prosecutors determined there was enough evidence to recommend an indictment.

""There are two sets of rules in this country and that's unacceptable,"" Moore said. ""If it was Darrius Stewart who was charged with manslaughter, he would have been immediately arrested."" 

Moore said he did not understand why Officer Schilling was not immediately arrested.

Moore requested for the City of Memphis to terminate Schilling's employment with the police department. However, he said if that did not happen Schilling should resign.

""We're also asking the police department of the City of Memphis to do the right thing. Surely if the D.A. thought that there was enough evidence for an indictment for manslaughter, this man should not still be a paid employee of the City of Memphis. We ask the city, the mayor, the police director to immediately terminate the employment of Connor Schilling,"" Moore said. ""If they will not terminate him, we ask Connor Schilling to do something right for a change and resign. This city has had enough, the Stewart family, Williams family, has had enough of Connor Schilling and we need justice.""

Meanwhile, Congressman Steve Cohen called for an immediate federal civil rights investigation into the case:

""I respectfully urge the Department of Justice to open an investigation immediately. We need to know whether any federal civil rights laws have been violated, and only the federal government has the resources, expertise and independence to give this matter the full, fair and public review it deserves.""
Stewart's family said they just wanted justice.

""Just want to see justice for my son because I don't think he deserves to be killed,"" Henry Williams, Stewart's father, said. ""You take your time trying to indict somebody, but then my son is in the ground. He's been buried long enough so we should have had justice way before then.""

Williams said he has been waiting for justice since his son was killed but now he has a message for the justice department.

""Do better. Make justice a little stronger than what you all are doing,"" Williams said.

TBI file: 'He seemed like he was going to give me no problems,' officer says
By Katie Fretland of The Commercial Appeal

Federal authorities are reviewing the fatal shooting of Darrius Stewart by a Memphis police officer, U.S. Attorney Edward Stanton said Monday.

A team of FBI agents, federal prosecutors and attorneys from the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division in Washington is conducting the review. Stanton said the review will be independent, impartial and thorough.

""It is important that we move in a timely manner towards a resolution in this case,"" Stanton said. ""It is equally important that we get it right. And we plan to do both.""

Darrius Stewart, a black 19-year-old, was shot July 17 by Connor Schilling, a white Memphis police officer, in Hickory Hill. Stewart was a passenger in a vehicle pulled over for a headlight violation. The officer put him in the back of a squad car. After verifying warrants, police said, the officer opened a door to the car to handcuff him and Stewart kicked the door and attacked him, striking him with the handcuffs. Video showed them tussling on the ground.

At a press conference Monday afternoon outside the courthouse at 140 Adams Ave., Stewart's father, Henry Williams, was flanked by attorneys Carlos Moore and Arthur Horne.

Moore said the federal review is ""welcome news to the family.

""We are cautiously optimistic that the Department of Justice will do a very thorough investigation ... We believe that the evidence will be there that will lead to hopefully an indictment at the federal level for criminal charges against Connor Schilling,"" he said.

Following news of the federal review, Williams said he feels ""a little better now.""

""They are trying to seek justice for my son and I really appreciate what they are doing,"" he said.

Moore filed a complaint with the DOJ against Schilling and the city of Memphis saying ""there are several eyewitnesses to the scuffle and the shooting and witnesses say Mr. Stewart was on his knees and had surrendered before the officer shot him twice.""

Schilling's lawyer, Arthur Quinn, has said that the officer used ""reasonable force"" during a ""struggle for his life.""

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation investigated the case and Shelby County District Attorney General Amy Weirich recommended Schilling be indicted on charges of voluntary manslaughter and using a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony. However, a state grand jury declined to indict Schilling.

The TBI's file in the investigation of Stewart is expected to be released publicly soon.

A Chancery Court judge said last week the file's release is in the public's best interest.

LONOKE - England police officer John Siems was justified in the Jan. 9 shooting death of Jimmy Foreman, Lonoke County Prosecuting Attorney Chuck Graham has determined.

LONOKE — England police officer John Siems was justified in the Jan. 9 shooting death of Jimmy Foreman, Lonoke County Prosecuting Attorney Chuck Graham has determined.

Foreman announced his determination in a letter to the England Police Department dated Thursday.

Graham wrote that after a review of evidence collected in the investigation of the officer-involved shooting, ""I find that Officer John Siems was fully justified in using lethal force upon Jimmy Foreman.""

The shooting occurred during a response to a 911 call of a shooting at the S.E. 3rd Street residence of Jimmy Foreman and his stepson, Dwain Foreman. The caller said there had been an argument between the two, after which Jimmy Foreman shot Dwain Foreman inside the residence.

In the letter, Graham said a witness told of hearing three more shots fired by Jimmy Foreman after Siems arrived and of seeing and hearing Siems tell Foreman multiple times to put down the gun.

Also, Graham said England officers James Pearson and Walter Moore told of witnessing Siems tell Foreman multiple times to put down the gun. Each said they heard Foreman tell Siems to ""just shoot me,"" and each said they saw Foreman fire another round into Dwain Foreman, then point his weapon towards Siems.

Jimmy Foreman his stepson both died at the scene.

""In this case it is abundantly clear that John Siems reasonably believed that Jimmy Foreman could use deadly physical force on him or other officers and/or citizens at the scene. … Officer Siems was forced to use deadly force upon Jimmy Foreman, and therefore he was justified under the Arkansas law of self-defense,"" Graham said in the letter.",No,,,,,,http://www.fox16.com/news/state-police-investigating-officer-involved-shooting-in-england,State Police Investigating Officer Involved Shooting in England,"State Police Investigating Officer Involved Shooting in England

PIKE COUNTY, MS (Mississippi News Now) - An investigation into an officer involved shooting is underway in Pike County.

""He was a really great guy. He loved his kids. He was an outdoorsy person and he worked hard for everything he had.""

Amy Boyd is struggling to understand what led a deputy to shoot the father of her three children just before he wrecked a four wheeler on McEwen Swamp Road on Sunday.

Pike County Sheriff Mark Shepherd says a deputy responded to calls that 35-year-old Troy Ray Boyd was riding an ATV, with a machete strapped to the back, and acting erratically.

The sheriff says when a deputy arrived, Boyd tried to run him over. The deputy then shot him and Boyd crashed the ATV. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

""I don't see him doing that,"" says Amy Boyd. ""I don't know why they shot him. There's three boys without a daddy now. How do you explain that?""

Boyd's family and friends were at the wreck scene on Monday.

Investigators say they found more weapons on the ATV but wouldn't go in to details.

Family members say his reported behavior was way out of his character.

""If you know Troy, the real Troy, he was a great person,"" says Amy Boyd. ""He spoke to you. He knew everybody and he tried his best to do what was right. He did not deserve what he got in the end.""

It's always routine for an officer involved in a shooting to be placed on paid leave and that's what is happening in this case, as well.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation has also been called in to assist in gathering evidence in the case.

The incident happened about 6:30 p.m. Sunday on McEwien Swamp Road in Ruth, which is northeast of McComb.

A witness, who didn't want to be identified, told 16 WAPT News that she called the Sheriff's Department after seeing a man with a machete riding a four-wheeler.

""The law came streaming by with their lights on,"" the witness said. ""I called the law back and told them they missed him. He came up here (and) turned to this road right here.""

Sheriff Mark Shepherd said Deputy Terry Beadle tried to stop Boyd, who then tried to run Beadle over with his four-wheeler. Beadle opened fire, killing Boyd, Shepherd said. 

""We pulled up to the scene, you know, where they had the road blocked,"" the witness said. ""We pulled up there and I asked the officer if (Boyd) was OK, and he just shook his head.""

Beadle is on administrative leave while the investigation -- which is being handled by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation -- is underway.

MAGNOLIA, MS (Mississippi News Now) -
A Pike County Grand Jury has indicted a sheriff's deputy in the death of Troy Ray Boyd in March of this year.

The indictment for manslaughter says that 35-year-old Terry Beadles did ""willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and unnecessarily"" kill Boyd.

Beadles was arrested Wednesday by investigators with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. Beadles is free on a $10,000 bond pending his initial court appearance. 

Pike County Sheriff Mark Shepherd told us back in March that Beadles responded to calls that 35-year-old Boyd was riding an ATV with a machete strapped to his back, acting erratic. 

The sheriff added that when Beadles arrived, Boyd tried to run over him. Beadles shot Boyd, who crashed the ATV and was pronounced dead at the scene.

His wife, Amy Boyd, talked with us back in March.

""I don't see him doing that I don't know why they shot him, said Amy. There's three boys without a daddy now, how do you explain that?""

The District Attorney’s Office recused itself from the case since it involved a local law enforcement officer. The case is being investigated by MBI and will be prosecuted by Assistant Attorney General Stanley Alexander.

If convicted of the charge, Beadles faces up to 20 years behind bars.

A woman who identified herself as Scott's wife said in a 911 call that her father-in-law shot Scott two times. The 911 dispatcher gave the woman CPR instructions as she waited for EMS to arrive.

Officers can be heard in the background of the 911 call telling Charles to put his hands up and drop the gun.

Scott was taken to the Twinsburg branch of the Cleveland Clinic and was pronounced dead at 6:30 p.m

A female victim was taken to Hillcrest Hospital. That patient's condition is unknown.

The officer who fired the shot has not yet been identified by the department. All officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave during the investigation per police policy.

TWINSBURG, Ohio — A Twinsburg police officer shot and killed an armed 76-year-old man following a domestic dispute at the man's house.

The officer, whose name was not released by police, shot Charles Shaw in the driveway of his home in the 2400 block of Sherwin Drive.

Officers from the Twinsburg police department were called to the home about 5:45 p.m. for a report of a domestic dispute involving gunshots.

The officers found Shaw's son, Scott Shaw, 55, outside the home with a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead about 45 minutes later at Cleveland Clinic's Twinsburg branch. 

The officer who fired the shot that killed Charles Shaw is a 32-year-old officer with more than three years experience in law enforcement. He was placed on paid administrative leave, which is part of the department's policy. 

Charles Shaw's 74-year-old wife was grazed by a bullet during the incident, according to Ohio Attorney General spokeswoman Jill Del Grecco. It is unknown if she was shot by her husband or if she was hit by police gunfire. 

Police did not know her condition on Wednesday. She was taken to Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights.

Warning: 911 call contains strong language
Police have not said whether Charles Shaw shot his son. But another woman at the home who called 911 said that Charles Shaw shot his son twice. The woman said her husband was shot in the arm and the stomach with a pistol.

The caller also told dispatchers that he was gasping for air. The dispatcher then instructed the woman how to give her husband CPR.

Twinsburg police found Charles Shaw standing near his son and reloading his gun, according to police. Officers ordered Charles Shaw to put his gun down several times, according to police and the 911 call. The woman on the phone with dispatchers also yelled at Charles Shaw to drop his gun. 

""Please, my husband is dying,"" the woman says during the call.

The officer eventually shot Charles Shaw. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the incident. 

Police have been to Shaw's home twice in the last two years. Both times Charles Shaw called to complain about his wife, who was suffering from an illness, according to police records. 

Scott Shaw and his wife recently moved in with his father, according to neighbors. Meredith Shaw, who lives across the street and is not related to the other Shaw family, said they were all good and quiet neighbors. She said their dogs used to play with each other from time to time. 

""They were really friendly,"" Meredith Shaw said. ""They treated everyone really nice.""

An earlier report from a medical examiner’s investigator says Shaw shot his son who was trying to stop his father from leaving home with a pistol and a rifle.
The report says Shaw was vowing to “do some damage” at a medical facility because he was upset about his medications.

Authorities said a person flagged down an officer on routine patrol and that a man was threatening to stab people at a house celebrating a toddler's birthday.

According to police, when the officer located the man, identified Tuesday as 26-year-old Darin Hutchins, he refused to drop the knife and obey commands. The officer shot him once in the chest.

Authorities said the officer, who has been on the force for about two years, made the appropriate notifications and then tried to help.

""This is indicative of a couple of things, one is, the officer being at the right place, the officer courageously confronting an individual who was armed and unfortunately, individuals who, in spite of an officer being in full uniform and giving very clear and precise directions, their refusing to follow those directions in what could be a a very deadly situation,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said.

Police said Hutchins received immediate medical treatment but later died at a hospital.

The officer, Donald Gaff, has been placed on administrative duty. Gaff has been a member of the Baltimore City Police Department since 2013.

Richmond Acting Deputy Police Chief Steve Drew hugged the mother of a man killed in an exchange of gunfire with police Wednesday near West Cary Street near the Fan District in Richmond. One police officer was wounded in the incident.

Posted: Wednesday, August 5, 2015 7:15 pm
BY NED OLIVER, TED STRONG AND BRANDON SHULLEETA Richmond Times-Dispatch
A man was fatally shot and a police officer wounded in a hectic exchange of gunfire Wednesday afternoon near Richmond’s Fan District, with the man firing shots at officers over his shoulder as he attempted to escape, according to accounts from witnesses and police.
The incident began when police were called to Meadow and West Cary streets at 5:21 p.m. in response to reports of an armed man in the area, Richmond police spokesman Gene Lepley said.
The officers located the suspect minutes later near a convenience store in the area and attempted to talk with the man, police said. A short foot chase and an exchange of gunfire followed, during which the officer was injured and the man killed.
A police source said the man was wanted for questioning in a separate shooting.
A witness said he saw police approach the man at Meadow Street in the alley between Cary Street and Parkwood Avenue.
“They wanted to ask him something — I don’t know,” said Lois G. Ambriz, a construction worker who was packing up his tools for the day at the time. “He started running away from them.”
Ambriz said the man knocked over a trash can as he ran and then ducked behind a nearby car that was parked in a driveway in the alley. That’s when the first of two quick exchanges of gunfire took place, he said.
Ambriz said he didn’t see who fired the first shots, but heard when the officer was shot.
“He was screaming,” he said. “Like, it was bad — he was screaming really bad.”
Ambriz said the man ran 50 feet or so, firing shots over his shoulder as he fled. The second officer pursued the man, shooting him moments later, he said.
Ambriz estimated the incident lasted less than a minute and that at least 15 shots were fired.
Police said a handgun was recovered near the man’s body, which was wrapped in a blanket and removed from the scene just before 8 p.m.
As of 9 p.m., police hadn’t identified the man.
A police car responding to the incident Monday afternoon overturned at Lombardy and Broad streets. The car was headed south to Cary Street when it struck a pole and overturned in a gas station parking lot, police said.
At a news conference Wednesday night, Richmond Police Chief Alfred Durham was greeted by an angry crowd of more than a dozen people, who shouted questions about the shooting and police policy.
Durham said that once an investigation has been completed, the findings will be turned over to the Richmond commonwealth’s attorney’s office, which will decide whether he believes police were justified in shooting the man.
The officer who was shot is white and a nine-year veteran of the department. He was struck once in his arm, and the injury is not considered life-threatening, Durham said.
Durham said the officer who was wounded and another officer fired, but until ballistic results are available, officials won’t know who shot the man. The chief insisted the incident had nothing to do with race, however.
Though police haven’t confirmed the man’s identity, friends and family at the scene identified him as a 20-year-old black man.

A man was fatally shot and a police officer wounded in a hectic exchange of gunfire Wednesday afternoon near Richmond’s Fan District.
Durham expressed sympathy for the man’s family, and officers on the scene were seen throughout the afternoon and evening consoling a woman identified as the man’s mother.
Emotions were high at the scene as friends and family members of the deceased arrived.
“They took my brother, and you all know how I feel about my brother,” said a man who collapsed to the sidewalk on Cary Street.
Emonie Smith, a friend of the man killed, said she had talked with him Tuesday. She remembered him as a good man and said he had no idea why he would be running from police.
“I don’t know. I’m just so tired of this violence,” she said.
Nearby residents were rattled by the shooting and its aftermath.
David Spratt, who lives at Cary and Rowland streets, said he woke up to someone screaming outside his window. He said he ran upstairs, where his roommates said they heard someone “unload a clip.”
Kate Miceli, whose home on Parkwood Avenue backs up to the alley where the shooting occurred, said police told her not to touch what might be a bullet hole in the foundation of her neighbor’s home. At that point, police had placed numbered crime scene markers throughout the alley and had cordoned off the surrounding street.
“It’s definitely scary,” Miceli said. “It’s not a good feeling.”
This is the second police-involved shooting in the Richmond area in three days. On Monday night, a Powhatan County sheriff’s deputy fatally shot a 71-year-old man after police say he refused to put down his rifle.

A Richmond Police Officer walks out of an alley at the scene of a shooting involving a police officer, who was wounded and another subject who was killed near W. Cary St in the Fan District of Richmond, VA Wednesday, August 5, 2015.
Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 6:37 pm
By TED STRONG Richmond Times-Dispatch
Richmond’s top prosecutor said he will not seek charges against the police officers involved in an August shooting that left a man dead and an officer wounded.
Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael N. Herring will not present the facts of the case to a grand jury, he said. Herring based his decision on his analysis of a report prepared by the Richmond Police Department’s force-investigation team.
“There was nothing in the ... report that caused me to think the public ought to be concerned about police behavior vis-à-vis this case,” he said. “Nothing at all.”
Even though Keshawn D. Hargrove, 20, was shot in the back, he was the aggressor, Herring said. Hargrove drew his weapon, fired it and hit an officer before being shot himself, Herring said.
Witnesses’ recollection of events supported the police on important points, Herring said.
“There were a number of civilian witnesses interviewed, and ... although they were not perfectly consistent, they corroborated the version of police in just about every significant way,” he said.
Police had been called to the area of West Cary and South Meadow streets just after 5:20 p.m. Aug. 5 to investigate reports of an armed man in the area. When officers approached Hargrove, he fled down the alley that runs parallel to and just south of Cary Street, police said. The chase quickly turned into a gunfight with police.
At the time, a witness told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that he saw Hargrove firing over his shoulder while running from police.
Officer Ryan Bailey was shot through the arm. Hargrove was shot and killed by officer Jacob DeBoard, Bailey’s colleague.
The investigation determined that Hargrove fired at least four shots from a 9 mm handgun that was recovered less than 10 feet from his body. Police fired 14 shots; one hit Hargrove.
“It really wasn’t the police that escalated this; it was Hargrove,” Herring said. “I think folks expect the police to exercise restraint but to apply proportional force when confronted by threats.”
Police Chief Alfred Durham praised Herring’s decision in a written statement.
“Today’s decision by Mr. Herring not to file charges against the officers is the result of a fair, impartial and independent investigation conducted by the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office,” he said.
In the aftermath of the shooting, some community members expressed outrage. DeBoard is white and Hargrove was black, but Durham said at the time that the shooting was not racially motivated. Bailey is black.
“This is not Ferguson,” Durham said at the time, referring to the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white officer last year in Ferguson, Mo., that sparked protests and nationwide scrutiny of police officers’ treatment of blacks.
Durham said in his statement Thursday that Herring’s decision showed how important it was for people to wait for all the facts to come in rather than rushing to judgment.
The two officers involved in the shooting will remain on administrative leave while the department completes its own investigation, Durham said.
Durham also said the shooting had a deep effect on all those involved.
“Regardless of today’s decision, my officers and the family members of Hargrove will be forever impacted by the events that took place on the day of the shooting,” he said in his statement.
Hargrove’s criminal record included a malicious wounding conviction for shooting a teenage girl when he was 15.",Yes,No,,No,,http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/67/9679345a-3bc6-11e5-835b-cfcd197c9ca8/55c296fce925d.image.jpg?resize=300%2C169,Yes,http://abcnews.go.com/US,BROKEN,BROKEN,No,,,,,,5:21 PM,Outdoors,Street/Road,,Police responding to a reported offense by the victim,,Intimidation/Threats,,None of the above,,No,Yes,No,No,"Run away from police,Shoot&nbsp;<u>first</u>&nbsp;at officer,Injure officer",,None of the above,,Fired weapon at officer,,,,Exact number given.

WORCESTER – A Fitchburg man who was shot with a Taser Wednesday after he allegedly went on a rampage inside the Pennywise Market died early Thursday.
Police said Wilmer Delgado-Soba, 38, died at 3:30 a.m. at St. Vincent Hospital. The confrontation with police occurred shortly after noon on Wednesday, inside the 3 May St. market.
Workers Thursday described an out-of-control man who created a chaotic scene at the small, Main South convenience store.
In an interview, Mike Maranda, the owner of Pennywise Market, said police “tried everything” before using the Taser.
Mr. Maranda said Mr. Delgado-Soba ""had come running in, bouncing all over the place, knocking stuff off the shelves.""
The store owner said the man caused about $150 worth of damage by the time he was done.
“It was something out of the unusual,” Mr. Maranda said. “It took three officers to try to subdue him.”
Mr. Maranda's wife, Rae-Ann Maranda, said she was working when the man entered with a broken beer bottle in hand.
“He came around, smashed our mirror, started opening our coolers and pulling out sodas and juices and smashing them all over the floors,” Mrs. Maranda said.
Mr. Delgado-Soba then lifted a case of water over his head and smashed it on the floor, she said.
The out-of-control man took a grocery basket and banged it against the store’s back window, then ran back and forth in the family-owned store, which has surveillance cameras.
Police said the cause of Mr. Delgado's death is undetermined and an autopsy would be conducted Friday. District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr. said he had been notified of the death and that the Worcester Police Department was conducting an investigation.
Police said officers went to the market about 12:30 p.m. on reports that Mr. Delgado-Soba was tearing up the store. Employees said the police called for an ambulance and started talking to the man, trying to calm him down. He didn't respond when they asked him why he destroyed items in the store, police said.
When police told Mr. Delgado-Soba to leave, he became violent and started to resist and swing at the officers, police said. At one point the man charged at the officers, prompting one officer to use his Taser. Police said the Taser appeared initially to have no effect, and the man ran to the opposite end of the store.
Police said he soon calmed down and they were ""were able to subdue him.""
Paramedics, who had placed Mr. Delgado-Soba on a stretcher, realized he was suffering from a medical condition, and while on the stretcher he attempted to fight with emergency personnel, police said.
Store employees said the more they spoke to Mr. Delgado-Soba, the more irate he became, Mrs. Maranda said. He eventually removed his pants.
Clad in his underwear, he sat down and poured a bottle of detergent on the floor, she said.
That’s when police arrived and tried talking to him, she said.
“The more they tried talking to him the more irate he got,” Mrs. Maranda said. “They kept saying, ‘You gotta get up,’ and ‘Let’s go out.’ “
Mrs. Maranda said the officers did not strike the man in any way.
“They tried very hard to talk to him,” she said, noting the man had resisted them by swinging his arms and hands.
“At some point they tried to put his hands behind his back,” she said. “He was fighting them tooth and nail.
""That’s when they Tased him,"" she said. They were eventually able to ""get him in some kind of a maneuver with his arms and cuffed him,” she said, demonstrating the maneuver.
Michael McCartney, associate professor of criminal justice at Anna Maria College in Paxton, said he read a press account of Mr. Delgado-Soba’s death.
“It would seem to me that that would be the kind of circumstance for which the Taser was developed,"" he said.
“I wasn’t there and I’m not a police officer,” Mr. McCartney noted. But in general, the Taser is used so that an officer doesn’t have to resort to using his or her firearm, he said.
Emergency radio communications indicate a dispatcher asked police to respond to the store at about 12:34 p.m. for a report of a shirtless Hispanic man with tattoos tearing up the place. Hear the scanner transmission.
“He’s destroying the store, and he’s got a couple bottles in his hands,” the dispatcher told responding officers.
Several minutes later the dispatcher asked the officer if the incident could be drug related.
“Yup, he’s tweaking,” the officer responded. “I’m trying to get him to answer me, but he’s not even answering me.”
The radio transmissions indicate that additional police, including EMTs, were called to the store. At one point, a police officer asked the EMTs to hurry up because “this guy’s a nut.”
“I did tell them he was off the wall,” the dispatcher said.
“He’s combative,” the officer responded.
Mr. Delgado-Soba had a history of criminal convictions.
In 2012 he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 2 years in the House of Correction after pleading guilty to assault with a dangerous weapon and breaking and entering in the daytime with intent to commit a felony. In 2009 he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 2 ½ years in the House of Correction, with 8 months to be served after pleading guilty to assault and battery and intimidation of a witness. The balance of the entence was suspended for 3 years with probation. Charges of assault with intent to murder, attempted murder, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and intimidation of a witness were dismissed at the request of the commonwealth.
Mr. Delgado-Soba was also convicted of trespassing and disorderly conduct last year in Central District Court. One of the disorderly conduct charges was amended from a charge of open and gross lewdness and Mr. Delgado-Soba was found responsible after the charge was decriminalized, according to court records. In that case, Mr. Delgado-Soba was arrested after police said they saw him urinating in a bottle on a public way in Worcester with his genitals exposed.
Mr. Delgado-Soba also had a trespassing charge pending against him in Central District Court. He was arrested on that charge June 18, after a police officer said he saw Mr. Delgado-Soba and another man standing beneath a ""No Trespassing by Loitering"" sign on a building on Charlton Street, according to court records. In a statement of facts filed in court, Officer Justin Bennes said the two men were leaning against Mr. Delgado-Soba's car with the trunk open and appeared to be preparing heroin for use. The officer said the man with Mr. Delgado-Soba was sticking a needle into his arm as he drove past the pair in his cruiser.
Mr. Delgado-Soba was due back in court Aug. 5.
Originally, Tasers were called non-lethal weapons, but now they’re generally referred to as less lethal because there have been instances that people died after being struck, the professor said.
About 16,000 agencies internationally use Tasers.
A variety of studies have been conducted on the topic.
In 2012, Amnesty International reported that the death toll from Tasers since 2001 had risen to more than 500 in the United States. An Amnesty International spokeswoman said Thursday that those were the most recent statistics the organization had compiled. It is working on updating the number but does not have a target for release of a new report.
In 2009, a study by the Police Executive Research Forum argued that as a result of its examination injuries to police had been reduced by 76 percent because they were able to use Tasers instead of having to rely on a more physical type of confrontation.
Mr. McCarthy said that in some cases it is believed that a pre-existing medical condition that the officer would have no way of knowing about, and even if a person has been using certain drugs, could magnify the effects of the Taser.
The Anna Maria professor also said that a diagnosis called ""excited delirium"" had been used by some coroners to explain deaths.
“It’s supposedly a condition that the National Association of Medical Examiners says is a real condition that can cause deaths as a result of a Taser, but it doesn’t appear in psychological literature,"" the professor said. “There are all these differences of opinion out there about how many deaths result and what the causes of them are.""
In 2012, the American Heart Association for the first time produced a scientific, peer-reviewed study that it said showed Tasers can cause cardiac arrest and death.

WORCESTER — A man whom police shocked with a Taser-type device on Wednesday after he allegedly wreaked havoc inside a Worcester market, smashing items and charging at officers, died Thursday, officials said.

Worcester police said Wilmer Delgado-Soba, 38, of Fitchburg, died at Saint Vincent Hospital, about 15 hours after the episode at Pennywise Market on May Street.

The cause of death remains undetermined, pending an autopsy scheduled for Friday, police said. Delgado-Soba’s family said Thursday that he went into cardiac arrest about 20 minutes after being hit by the electroshock device.

His mother, Cecilia Soba, said in a brief interview in Spanish, which a friend translated, that the officers’ actions were “not justified for the crime he committed.” His uncle, Edwin Soba, said police should have treated Delgado-Soba differently, considering his state of mind at the time.

Edwin Soba did not elaborate, but Worcester Police Chief Gary J. Gemme said in a statement that “possible opiate use” and a “possible medical condition” may have contributed to Delgado-Soba’s violent behavior at the market.

He said police appear to have acted appropriately, based on video surveillance and witness statements, and “there is no indication” of excessive force.

Delgado-Soba entered the store at about 12:30 p.m. wearing only shorts and was asked to leave, as customers are required to wear shirts and shoes, police said. He flew into a rage and smashed a glass with a candle inside, police said in a separate statement.

He then sprinted around the store while clutching the shattered glass and began smashing more items, police said, at one point slamming down a shopping cart. He removed his shorts and tried to pour laundry detergent on them, eventually sitting on the floor until police arrived, the statement said.

The officers, who requested the assistance of paramedics, approached Delgado-Soba slowly and asked why he smashed the items.

He gave no response and later swung at officers and charged at them, according to police. One of the officers fired his electroshock device after Delgado-Soba allegedly ignored warnings to stop his outburst.

After being shocked, Delgado-Soba ran to the opposite end of the store, police said, and when he appeared to have calmed down, officers subdued him. But while on a stretcher, he began fighting with the paramedics, who discovered that he had a medical condition that worsened en route to the hospital, police said. Authorities did not elaborate on the condition.

Police did not say whether Delgado-Soba was armed when he charged at officers, and a department spokesman could not be reached for comment. Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr.’s office, which will review the case, referred questions to police. The Worcester Police Department is investigating the matter.

Gemme identified the officers who encountered Delgado-Soba as Derrick Leto, an 11-year veteran; Rick Noonan, a 19-year-veteran; and Jon Kachadoorian, who has served for 21 years. Gemme did not say who fired the device, and he offered condolences to Delgado-Soba’s family.

The chief did not directly address the officers’ work status but said that in similar situations, officers are placed on paid administrative leave and required to undergo medical evaluations.

Before Delgado-Soba entered the market Wednesday, he had a bizarre encounter at the nearby 1000 Watts barbershop, said Jason Laracuente, who works there. He said Delgado-Soba rushed in and began shouting in Spanish about the need to defend himself.

He grabbed a child’s booster seat but put it down when he was asked to do so, Laracuente said. He said Delgado-Soba then sprinted out of the barbershop.

Delgado-Soba had prior brushes with law enforcement, including convictions for assault, breaking and entering, and trespassing, the Worcester Telegram & Gazette reported.

At the market Thursday, Joe Biladeau, 28, of Worcester, said he was standing outside the store on Wednesday as Delgado-Soba slurred his words, started a fight with three men, and then pushed him before entering the store.

Nicholas Perritt, a store employee, said Thursday at the Pennywise Market that Delgado-Soba destroyed condiments and juices and threw paper towels and candles.

“I feel bad for the guy, but he made his choice,” Perritt said. “It’s too bad.”

UPDATE: Deceased teen who shot Bay City police officer had extensive juvenile record

BAY CITY, MI -- A 17-year-old Bangor Township man authorities say shot a Bay City police officer, and was shot multiple times himself in return, has died.

Michigan State Police Lt. David Kaiser and Bay City Public Safety Director Michael J. Cecchini confirmed the teen died on Sunday, Feb. 15. His family had decided to remove him from life support, Kaiser said.

The teen was hospitalized at Hurley Medical Center in Flint following a shootout with Bay City Public Safety Officer Brandon S. Murphy, police have said. Murphy and another officer responded to a home invasion complaint in the 1600 block of Third Street at 1:28 a.m. on Feb. 2.

While the other officer spoke with the home owner, Murphy tracked the suspect's footprints through freshly fallen snow, encountering him in the 1600 block of Fourth Street at 1:36 a.m., police have said. The suspect responded to Murphy's orders by pulling a gun and opening fire on him, striking him once in the left thigh, police have said.

Murphy returned fire and his bullets struck the teen multiple times, police have said.

Bay City police conducted an investigation pertaining solely to the home invasion complaint, resulting in the Bay County Prosecutor's Office on Monday, Feb. 9, issuing a warrant charging the teen with first-degree home invasion, breaking and entering with intent, and breaking and entering a motor vehicle causing damage. The suspect was not arraigned on the charges prior to his death.

Michigan State Police investigators have been conducting a separate investigation regarding the incident, which is standard for any police-involved shooting.

Murphy, a 14-year veteran of the department, was released from the hospital the afternoon of Feb. 3 and has been recovering at home, according to Cecchini.",Yes,No,,Yes,http://media.mlive.com/news/baycity_impact/photo/16914432-small.jpg,"http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/pgthumb/img/baycitytimes/photo/2015/02/02/-035f2f76f6ed33ca.JPG  ,

BAY CITY, MI (WNEM) - The police officer who was shot while investigating an attempted breaking and entering in Bay City is back on the job and prosecutors are not pressing charges.

Brandon Murphy was injured after being shot in the leg last month in pursuit of a teen suspect, Jacob Haglund. Haglund, 17, passed away in early February, after spending weeks on life support.
The incident happened at a home at the intersection of Fourth and Hampton streets on Bay City's east side. According to police, Murphy and another officer responded to a home for a report of an attempted breaking and entering.

One officer was talking to a resident while officer Murphy searched the area. Murphy encountered the suspect and ordered him to stop. The suspect then allegedly pulled a gun on Murphy and shot him. Murphy returned fire, striking the suspect.

Bay County prosecuting attorney Kurt Asbury said the shooting by Murphy was justified, adding Murphy was protecting his own life.

""All of a sudden we heard about five or six gunshots, just bop bop bop, and about five seconds later we looked out the window and we seen all the cop cars coming,"" Jeff Johnson said.

Johnson lives in the 1600 block of Third Street on the east side of the city. Just before those shots were fired one of his neighbors called police, saying someone had broken into her house.

The white male suspect then ran away. Two officers arrived at the scene, one of them Murphy, followed some footprints in the snow and saw the suspect about a block away.

""Confronts the suspect, then the suspect doesn't obey commands, and the suspect pulls out a firearm, a handgun, fires at officer Murphy striking him in the leg. Officer Murphy returns fire, striking the suspect multiple times,"" said Michael Cecchini, director of Bay City Public Safety.

The shooting alarms residents.

""For us just moving in, with four kids, kind of gets me kind of scared,"" Johnson said.

Cecchini said it's unusual for this type of incident to happen on the east side of Bay City.

One Man Dead After Police Involved Shooting In Miami
CBS Miami

A man who police said refused to put down his gun, instead pointing it at officers, died Sunday after he was shot by cops in Little Havana.

The shooting happened after officers responded to a domestic disturbance call at about 1:30 p.m. at 2482 SW Third St., Miami police spokeswoman Frederica Burden said.

When officers arrived, they found a woman with cuts, but the man wasn’t there, Burden said.

“He shows back up to the location not knowing police were there,” Burden said.

That’s when there were reports of gunfire, but police didn’t say who fired first. Then the man got in a car, leading police to follow through Little Havana.

“He was driving erratically in pouring rain,” Burden said.

He finally stopped at Southwest 30th Avenue and Fourth Street.

“It’s just where he stopped and brandished that handgun,” she said. “The officers feared for their own safety when he failed to comply.”

The man was taken to Ryder Trauma Center where he died from his injuries, Burden said.

No officers were injured.

The woman was also taken to Ryder Trauma Center. She was listed in critical condition.

Like all police-involved shootings in Miami, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating,

BEECH GROVE, Ind. -- A man was fatally shot in Beech Grove on Monday afternoon in what police called a ""classic case of suicide by cop.""

Officers were called to a home on Main and South 4th streets just before 3 p.m.

A man who was believed to be intoxicated allegedly told police over and over to shoot him, officers with the Beech Grove Police Department said.

The man refused commands to put his gun down and reportedly pointed his weapon at police, authorities said. That is when officers said they felt they had no other choice and one officer fired one shot at the man.

BEECH GROVE, Ind. (WISH) — A man is dead after a police action shooting in Beech Grove.

Police confirmed that James Johnson, 54, Beech Grove, was shot by police on Monday. The shooting occurred on South 4th Avenue before 3:00.

Major Tom Hurrle with BGPD said that officers were called to the scene for a possible suicidal person.

Officers arrived and found a man on a porch waving a gun and saying to officers “shoot me.”

Hurrle said five or six officers were on the scene as the man continued to goad police into shooting him while waving the gun and walking toward them in the street.

Hurrle said officers tried to get the man to drop the weapon. Officers shot him after he raised the gun in their direction.

Beech Grove Police said they never want a situation to reach that point, but for the safety of their officers and the people in the neighborhood, they feel it was their only option.

“Tragedy, it’s definitely a tragedy,” said Jazmine Johnson (no relation) who lives a few doors down. She witnessed the incident unfold as she pulled up to her home. “It’s devastating to know that it’s somebody close, somebody I knew.”

As investigators analyzed the scene, crowds formed up and down the block. And it’s those exact people police said they were trying protect when they shot the armed man.

“We can’t gamble away their safety thinking well maybe he’s just emotionally disturbed and if we let him walk and talk this out eventually he’ll just stop,” said Major Hurrle. “We don’t have the option to see and hope that that’s going to be the case.”

Major Hurrle called the incident “suicide by police,” meaning Johson provoked the officers into killing him. It’s not the way officers wanted to the situation to end, but felt it was necessary in order to keep people safe.

“Down at the other end of the street a little bit ago there was probably 10-15 little kids watching this from outside the police tape and who knows where they were before that. Maybe just right around the corner,” he said.

Neighbors said Johnson had a history of mental illness. Sunday night, the Beech Grove Fire Department said it got a call about a man unconscious on a front porch at Johnson’s address. They said the man was breathing but was taken to Eskenazi Health. Fire fighters could not confirm if the man who was hospitalized was Johnson.

Beech Grove Police said they’ve been called to Johnson’s home four times in the past eight months but could tell us the reasons why.",Yes,No,,No,,http://wishtv.com/2015/06/08/beech-grove-police-involved-in-police-action-shooting/,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3:00 PM,Outdoors,Residence,,Police responding to a reported offense by the victim,,None of the above,,Suicidal behavior or threats.

WASCO, Calif. - A 34-year-old Hispanic man is dead after an officer involved shooting early Monday morning in the 1100 block of E Street in Wasco.



According to deputies, around 6:39 a.m. they responded to a call of a suspect making threats to himself. 

When they arrived they saw his vehicle in the driveway, and due to previous calls to this home where the suspect would leave, a deputy used his car to block the suspect's vehicle and prevent him from leaving.

One deputy said he got out and heard yelling and screaming from inside the home. The deputy forced entry and saw the suspect on a couch in the living room armed with a knife.

One deputy attempted to talk to the suspect, another later deployed a taser unsuccessfully.

Deputies said the man then charged them brandishing a knife, so one deputy then fired and struck the suspect who was later taken into custody.

CPR was performed and the suspect was taken to Delano Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

On Tuesday, February 10, the Kern County Sheriff's Incident Review Board convened and found that the use of force by Sr. Deputy Reed was within Sheriff's Office policy.

Officers shot and killed a man Sunday morning in a Provo neighborhood after he allegedly pointed a rifle at them that later turned out to be an Airsoft firearm replica.

Police identified the man as Cody Evans, 24, of Springville.

At 7:59 a.m., dispatchers received a ""chaotic"" 911 call involving domestic violence, according to a Provo Police Department news release. Officers responding to the call found Evans inside his vehicle near Paul Ream Wilderness Park, near 1600 West and 500 North.

""The suspect barricaded himself inside the vehicle and presented an AR-15 style weapon to officers,"" the release said. ""At one point, while officers were attempting to speak to the suspect with their PA systems the suspect racked the charging handle on the rifle.""

Evans allegedly told officers he was going to ram their vehicles and revved his engine. Officers set up spike strips, but Evans drove away and over someone's lawn to avoid the strips, police said.

Officers pursued him for a short time but called off the chase after Evans allegedly feigned ramming an officer and ran a red light. Police determined the chase was too dangerous to continue.

But officers kept looking for Evans' vehicle, and found it again about 9:30 a.m. near 1800 West and 600 South. They saw him leave an outbuilding wearing a tactical vest, the release said.

Police ordered him to stop and show his hands, but he ignored their commands, ran to his truck, opened the door and pulled out the rifle, police said.

""The suspect then immediately pointed the rifle at officers who engaged him,"" the release said. Evans died at the scene.

""It all went down pretty quick,"" said Provo police Lt. Brandon Post. There was about 100 feet between the officers and Evans, Post said.

Police said two officers were involved in the shooting, one from the Provo Police Department and one from the Utah County Sheriff's Office. They fired three rounds at Evans, but it was not immediately clear whether Evans fired at them, Post said. Neither officer had a body camera.

PROVO, Utah — Provo police released new details Monday regarding the fatal shooting of a suspect armed with an airsoft gun.

Cody Evans, 24, of Springville, was shot and killed by police after he pointed an AR-15 style airsoft gun at officers Sunday morning.

According to new information provided by police, a 911 caller, who was initially difficult to understand, managed to communicate that there had been a domestic violence incident at her residence near 1300 West and 500 North.

“The victim tells the dispatcher that Cody Evans has a gun, but later describes it as a ‘BB gun’ and she says he ‘is going to use it when officers pull him over,’” according to a statement released on the Provo police Facebook page.

When dispatch asked the caller to identify to gun, she said “it’s black and ‘it looks real.’”

The information was then relayed via radio to responding officers.

Soon after the call, the release states, officers located Evans inside his vehicle at the end of a cul-de-sac just before 8 a.m. Despite attempts to start dialogue, Evans reportedly refused to speak with officers.

“During this encounter, Evans displays a black rifle that looks like an AR-15 and racks the charging handle on it,” the statement indicates.

Provo officers on scene state that when Evans activated the charging handle mechanism, it made a distinct “metal on metal” sound.

“From the look and sound of the rifle, officers are afraid that Evans has a real AR-15, and they immediately deploy ballistic shields for protection,” according to the statement.

It was at that point, the release states, Evans threatened he would shoot and ram police vehicles if they didn’t let him go.

Evans revved his engine and officers repositioned their vehicles and laid out spike strips to keep him from fleeing the area, the release states.

“Evans then drives over someone’s lawn to avoid the spike strips and escape,” the release indicates. “Officers pursue Evans for a short distance, however after he runs a red light, and crosses a double yellow line threatening to ram an officer head on, officers determine that

Evans’ actions have escalated to the point where the pursuit is too dangerous to continue.”

After the pursuit, the release indicates officers continue to look for the suspect and process the scene of the original domestic violence call.

“At the scene, one officer locates a realistic looking airsoft rifle and communicates this to officers over radio,” the release states. “One of the officers searching for Evans asks, ‘When he racked the rifle it didn’t sound like a pellet gun. Do you think that’s the fake one and maybe he has another one?’ The officer who located the airsoft gun told the officer that he didn’t know.”

Evans was later found at 9:30 a.m. at a home in the area of 1800 West and 600 South.

Evans was seen exiting an outbuilding wearing a tactical vest and holster, the release states. He was not carrying the AR-15 style rifle with him at this time.

As soon as he walked out of the structure, the release states, officers began issuing commands for Evans to stop and show his hands.

Evans didn’t respond and gestured like he was pointing a handgun at officers, according to the release.

Officers had taken cover behind a parked car.

As officers continued to issue commands, the release states, Evans ignored and ran to his truck, opened the door, pulled out the AR-15 style weapon and pointed it directly at officers.

Fearing for their lives, the release states, officers shot three rounds from approximately 100 feet away.

Evans died at the scene.

After the shooting, detectives examined the rifle and discovered it was an airsoft gun.

“It appears the rifle originally had an orange tip on the muzzle, however the tip had been removed,” the release states.

Real firearms were discovered in the outbuilding Evans exited prior to the shooting, the release stated.

Provo Police Officer Zac Lazenby and Utah County Sheriff’s Deputy Chris Bagley were involved in the shooting.

Lazenby has eight years of experience in law enforcement. Bagley has 15 years of experience.

Provo Police Chief John King released a statement addressing the fatal officer-involved shooting.

NEEDLES >> Sheriff’s deputies killed a Highland man, who had indicated he wanted to hurt himself, after the 50-year-old pointed a pistol at a deputy, the Sheriff’s Department said Saturday.

Jackie Brand was reported missing by his friends and family after he left work early Friday.

“Brand made statements to friends indicating he was intending to harm himself,” deputies in Grand Terrace learned when they took the missing person’s report, according to a Sheriff’s Department statement.

Deputies in Needles “were requested to contact Brand and check on his welfare” after he was located in the 4100 block of Needles Highway about 4:30 p.m. Friday.

Brand brandished a loaded 9-millimeter handgun and refused deputies orders to drop it, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

“Brand pointed the handgun directly at a deputy, forcing the deputy to use lethal force against Brand,” the sheriff’s statement said.

Brand was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 52-year-old Smyrna man shot and killed by town police early Saturday pointed a shotgun at officers after refusing to drop the weapon, authorities are now saying.

Police initially said the man refused to drop the gun after being ordered to do so several times, but now say he acted in a threatening manner before an officer used lethal force.

The dead suspect, Kenneth Mathena, was shot about 12:20 a.m. Saturday after police were called a second time within an hour to his home on Malvern Lane at Sunnyside Apapartments about a domestic dispute with his girlfriend.

Police said Mathena had fled the complex when they showed up about 11:15 p.m. But on the second visit they found him outside Building 30 and was told several times to drop the gun.

Instead Mathena “then turned toward the officers, allegedly pointed the firearm at them,’’ and one officer responded by firing several shots, police spokesman Cpl. Brandon Dunning said. Mathena was taken to Bayhealth Emergency Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Mathena is not believed to have fired the shotgun, which was found next to his body, Dunning said.

Dunning has not said how many shots the officer fired, fired, but residents reported hearing up to nine shots. At the scene Saturday morning, eight bullet holes were visible in vehicles and exterior walls.

Dunning said Dover police, at his agency’s request, are investigating the circumstances of the shooting in conjunction with Attorney General Matt Denn’s office. Smyrna police are “cooperating fully,’’ said Dunning, adding that no additional details will be released until the investigation is concluded.

The police officer who shot Mathena was not identified but Dunning said he is a patrol corporal with 11 years on the force who has been placed on administrative leave pending the probe’s outcome. Dunning said he believes the fatal shooting was the first one ever by a Smyrna police officer. The town of 11,000 has a 22-person force.

Officers were initially called on Friday at 11:23 p.m., about a domestic dispute in which the boyfriend was armed at apartment building #30 on Malvern Lane in Sunnyside Village. At that time, the suspect wasn't found.

Police received a second report about the armed suspect returning to the apartment on Saturday at about 12:18 a.m.

When officers arrived, they found Mathena in front of building #30 on Malvern Lane. Officers saw that he was holding a firearm and immediately began giving repeated verbal commands to Mathena to put the gun down and drop the weapon, Dunning said.

Mathena refused to comply with the verbal commands and then turned towards officers, allegedly pointing the firearm at them, Dunning said. It was at this time the officer shot the armed suspect. Methena's shotgun was recovered at the scene by investigators.

Officers from the Clayton Police Department and the Delaware State Police immediately responded to the scene to provide assistance with this incident.

At the beginning of this investigation, the Smyrna Police Department contacted and requested assistance from an outside agency who was not involved in this incident -- the City of Dover Police Department.

""At the request of our agency, the investigation into the shooting is being conducted by the City of Dover Police Department in conjunction with the State of Delaware Attorney’s General Office,"" Dunning said. ""The Smyrna Police Department is cooperating fully with the investigation.""

The incident happened May 2 at Sunnyside Village Apartments in Smyrna.

By Staff Report
The Delaware Department of Justice has ruled that a Smyrna police officer was justified in shooting a suspect who had a gun on May 2 at Sunnyside Village Apartments.

Cpl. David Walton shot and killed suspect Kenneth S. Mathena, 52, who was carrying a shotgun, after officers responded to a report of a domestic disturbance on Malvern Place.

“The investigation of the facts and circumstances fully supports the reasonableness of Cpl. Walton’s belief that his life and the lives of other officers and bystanders were in danger,” according to the report issued Sept. 8 by Allison E. Reardon, Director of the Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust. “As a result, the use of deadly force by Cpl. Walton was justified and is not subject to criminal prosecution.”

Smyrna Police Chief Norman Wood gave this statement in response to the report:

“It is very unfortunate that one of our officers was forced to use deadly force as a result of someone else’s actions. As we value all life, the use of deadly force is something that we all hope we will never have to face during our career. My officer did his job according to our policies and state law and I can’t ask of any more than that,” Wood said.

According to the DOJ report, the incident began on May 1 at 11:22 p.m., when Mathena’s girlfriend told police that she and Mathena had argued, that he was intoxicated, having a breakdown, and was armed with a shotgun. She said Mathena knocked over a TV, threw his drink at her, and threw his glass on the floor. Her adult son, who lived in the apartment, arrived home and saw Methena crying and the overturned TV. The son asked if everything was OK. They said yes, and the son went to his room, but he heard the argument continue.

When the girlfriend asked Methena to leave, he got a shotgun from their bedroom. The son came out of his room when he heard the pump of the shotgun. Mathena reportedly walked toward his girlfriend and her son, holding the shotgun. The girlfriend and her son locked themselves in a bedroom and called police.

When police arrived, Mathena had left. Police searched the apartment and the neighborhood but didn’t find him, and issued a radio report with a description of the vehicle he was believed to be driving.

After police left, Mathena returned to the apartment, knocked on the door, and said he needed to get his things. His girlfriend told him to leave, but he used his key and entered, still holding the shotgun, according to the DOJ report.

The girlfriend’s son had a handgun, and Methena reportedly yelled at the son to shoot him. The girlfriend and her son locked themselves in the bedroom again, blocked the door with a dresser, and called police.

Smyrna police received the call May 2 at 12:18 a.m. Three officers responded, two approached the front of the apartment from the west, and another was on the north side of the apartment building. Mathena was standing on the front porch of the apartment with the shotgun in his hands. Walton and Cpl. Ramon Armstrong, who took cover behind parked cars, ordered Mathena to drop the gun. Mathena refused and shouted a profanity at the officers. Walton fired his department rifle 10 times.

“He repeated his command for Mr. Mathena to drop the weapon two additional times and then fired one additional shot, striking Mr. Mathena,” the report said.

Officers gave first aid to Mathena until medical personnel arrived. Mathena was taken to Bayhealth Emergency Center on Carter Road in Smyrna where he was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the chest at 12:56 a.m.

Mathena’s gun wasn’t loaded, the report said. There was one round of ammunition on the front seat of his vehicle.

Mathena’s girlfriend and her son were in the apartment but they didn’t see the shooting.

A neighbor across the street who witnessed the shooting said he saw Mathena on the porch with what appeared to be a shotgun. He heard the police yelling commands for Mathena to drop the gun, but Mathena didn’t comply. He said he saw Mathena appearing to point the gun at the officers and then heard the shots. He saw the officers giving first aid to Mathena, according to the report.

The investigation was conducted by DOJ Chief Investigator Jean Rothenburger.

“Investigators examined the crime scene and also reviewed evidence, reports written by officers who responded to the scene and witness interviews,” according to the report.

After the shooting, the Smyrna police asked the Dover Police Department to investigate the case and report to the Attorney General’s Office since the Dover department wasn’t involved in the incident, according to Smyrna police Cpl.

A Delaware state trooper shot and killed a man early Sunday after responding to a burglary alarm in Claymont.

Delaware State Police Sgt. Richard D. Bratz said a 16-year veteran of the police force was dragged by the man's vehicle after arriving at the Rite Aid at Northtowne Plaza in the 600 block of Naamans Road in Claymont just after 130 a.m.

The trooper, who was not named by police, arrived at the store and saw the 35-year-old man's vehicle parked in the back of the building. As the trooper exited his vehicle, he saw the man leaving the Rite Aid and quickly entering his vehicle, Bratz said. The man attempted to drive off with the trooper at his opened driver's side door, dragging the trooper as he reversed the vehicle. His car then struck the trooper's marked Tahoe. Bratz said the man again attempted to drive off, dragging the trooper more. At that point, Bratz said, the trooper fired his work-issued weapon, striking the man in the upper torso.

Bratz said the trooper immediately rendered aid to the man until EMS arrived. He was airlifted to Christiana Hospital, where he was pronounced dead just after 4 a.m. The man has not been identified by police.

The trooper suffered lacerations and contusions and was transported to Wilmington Hospital where he was treated and released, Bratz said.

The trooper, assigned to Troop 1 in Claymont, was placed on administration leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

CLAYMONT, Del. >> A Delaware State trooper shot and killed a burglary suspect during an early morning break-in at the Northtowne Plaza Rite Aid Sunday, authorities said.

Michael L. McKillop, 35, was identified as the 35-year-old suspect who was shot after allegedly burglarizing the Rite Aid, located in the shopping plaza on Naamans Road early Sunday

According to state police, it was approximately 1:35 a.m. when a trooper responded to a burglary alarm at the Rite Aid. The trooper spotted the suspect’s vehicle, a burgundy 1999 Oldsmobile, parked behind the Rite Aid and got out of his marked Chevy Tahoe.

McKillop walked out of the rear door of the Rite Aid and jumped into his car as the trooper approached, state police said. He allegedly tried to drive away, with the trooper at his driver’s side door.

McKillop dragged the trooper as he reversed his vehicle, striking the trooper’s marked SUV, state police said. He put the car in drive and attempted to flee, continuing to drag the trooper, according to authorities.

The trooper, who was not named, fired his service weapon, striking McKillop in the upper Torso.

McKillop, of the 150 block of Rosebury Street in Philadelphia, was airlifted to Christiana Hospital by the Delaware State Police Aviation Unit. He was pronounced dead at approximately 4:08 a.m.

The trooper, a 16-year veteran of the Delaware State Police, was transported to Wilmington Hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries and was later released. He was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

The Oldsmobile McKillop was driving was reported stolen out of Philadelphia, state police said. Online court records indicate McKillop has an extensive criminal history including convictions for weapons violations, robbery, theft and drugs.

WACO, TX (KXXV) -
A suspected shoplifter at a North Waco grocery store died late Tuesday night. Randall Lance Hughes, 48, from Waco was shot by police after officers say he threatened them with a knife. 

Waco Police responded to the H.E.B located at the 3801 North 19th Street after 3:20 p.m. for a shoplifting incident. Hughes is accused of stealing $80 worth of brisket.

Waco Police spokesman Sgt. Patrick Swanton said when two Waco Police officers arrived, Hughes was detained in a small security room located in the back of the store. As officers tried to arrest him, he became combative. During the fight, the suspect pulled out a folding lock blade knife and threatened officers.

""The officers reacted out of fear for their lives and their partner's life and had to use their weapons,"" Sgt. Swanton, said.

He said at that point, the female officer activated a stun gun, which did not work on Hughes. Soon after the male officer fired at least two rounds at the suspect, according to Waco Police. 

""This is a critical incident anytime an officer is involved in an incident like this. It’s not something you come to work expecting or you want to do. But part of our duty is to protect our citizens in Waco and that’s what occurred here today,"" said Swanton. 

Hughes was shot at least twice in the upper torso. Additional officers who responded to the scene after the shooting was reported at 3:40 p.m. attempted to provide emergency medical treatment to suspect until ETMC arrived. He was rushed into surgery at Baylor Scott & White at Hillcrest Medical Center.

Both of the officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave. Waco Police will conduct criminal and internal investigations surrounding this case.

H.E.B evacuated their employees and customers on Tuesday after the incident occurred.  No one else besides the suspect was injured during the shooting. The grocery store was closed and reopened on Wednesday at 6 a.m.

Hughes was no stranger to law enforcement.

He was arrested three years ago when he was an employee at Home Depot on West Waco Dr. Police said he helped people steal from that store on at least two separate occasions in 2012.

According to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, he served 18 months for theft. He was released from prison in Jan. of 2015.",Yes,No,,No,,http://kxxv.images.worldnow.com/images/8542861_G.jpg,Yes,http://www.mycentx.com/news/waco-news/mclennan-county-grand-jury-clears-officers-involved-in-heb-shooting,McLennan County Grand Jury clears officers involved in HEB shooting,"McLennan County Grand Jury clears officers involved in HEB shooting

WACO, Tx

A McLennan County Grand Jury issued ""No Billed"" Wednesday, for two officers involved in the August HEB shooting.

The officer involved shooting occurred on August 11th at the Waco HEB at 3801 N. 19th Street. 

Officer Fernando Flores and Officer Rebecca Diaz shot and killed 48 year old Randall Hughes who was attempting to steal $80 worth of brisket. Police say Hughes resisted arrest and threatened the officers with a knife. 

The Waco Police department completed two separate investigations on the incident, one of which included the assistance of the Texas Rangers. Both the administrative and the criminal investigation showed the involved officers followed department training, procedures and state law. 

Chief Stroman released a statement after the No Bill determination:

""Per Department protocol the two officers have been cleared by two separate and thorough investigations as is routine in the officer involved shootings. These officers were forced into a life or death situation by an armed suspect and they acted in defense of themselves and others. We are appreciative of the job conducted by the Departments Investigators, the Texas Rangers, the McLennan County DA's office and the Grand Jury in this case.""

Officer Flores and Officer Diaz are expected to return to full duty.

A sword-wielding man shot by police Thursday at Blenheim Park has died. He was identified by authorities Friday as Javon Hawkins, 21, of Kansas City.

Hawkins died at a hospital overnight after a Kansas City police officer shot him in the park on Gregory Boulevard, just west of the Paseo, late Thursday afternoon.

Police said Hawkins was armed with a sword and threatened a police officer, who shot him. The officer had responded about 4:45 p.m. to a report that Hawkins was swinging the sword at passers-by and vehicles.

A police officer confronted Hawkins and asked him to put the sword down, said Capt. Tye Grant, a police spokesman. Hawkins did not, Grant said, and the officer felt threatened and shot the man in the torso. Neighbors living near the park said they heard four shots.

Grant said he did not know if the man was intoxicated at the time or if he lived near the area where the shooting occurred.

The officer who shot him was placed on administrative leave while the incident is being investigated, Grant said. The officer was assigned to the Metro Patrol Division. Grant said he did not know how long the officer has been with the Police Department.

KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) -
An officer shot a man who was swinging a sword at people in east Kansas City Thursday.

The man, identified as 21-year-old Javon M. Hawkins, passed away overnight at the hospital. 

It happened in the 7800 block of Highland Avenue, just south and west of East Gregory Boulevard and The Paseo, about 4:45 p.m. 

A KCPD spokesperson said officers were told Hawkins was swinging a sword at passing vehicles and people.

Officers found him in Blenheim Park. They said he refused officers' commands to put the sword down. 

Spokesman Capt. Tye Grant said the man turned towards a female officer and she shot him because she feared for her safety. 

A witness said the object looked more like a metal bar than a sword, but also said the man was acting strange and she was worried for her safety.

""I seen him down there just twirling in circles, screaming, taking off his clothes, just being strung out,"" Kechelle Herring said. 

Hawkins was shot in the abdomen and taken to the hospital with critical injuries. The officer wasn't hurt. She was placed on administrative leave, per department policy.

EL MONTE >> An El Monte man accused of killing his mother-in-law and wife then wounding his brother-in-law died Monday from his injuries.

Sheriff’s Homicide Detective Ray Lugo said William Chau, 59, was pronounced dead at 4:52 p.m. at Los Angeles County USC Medical Center.

An El Monte police officer shot Chau Sept. 9 after police saw him holding his injured wife, Lan Vuong, at knifepoint. Chau allegedly refused to drop the knife.

In addition to the gunshot wound, Lugo said 60 percent of Chau’s body was burned. He was injured after he allegedly set his wife on fire.

Lan Vuong, who suffered burns to 90 percent of her body, died Sept. 10 at a hospital. Her mother, 80-year-old Nguyet Phit Dang, died from stab wounds the day before.

Relatives told detectives Chau had been threatening his family for the past 30 years, according to Lugo.

“He threatened to hurt them,” Lugo said.

The sole survivor in the Sept. 9 assault in the 3900 block of Glen Way is Chau’s brother-in-law, 48-year-old Duc Vuong. He was stabbed in the arm and got burned.

Detectives, who interviewed the brother-in-law, believe Chau set fire to his wife then put her in a chair in the family dining room/living room. The blaze spread when items near Lan Vuong caught fire.

Lugo said Chau stabbed his brother-in-law and his mother-in-law when they tried to help his wife.

Duc Vuong fled from the home and was found a couple of blocks away. Officers discovered Dang in a back bedroom of the burning house. She later died at a hospital.

Midland police are investigating two very different incidents that left two men dead Saturday night.
In one incident, police are believed to have killed a man outside a west Midland local liquor store; in the other, a pedestrian was killed by a train, city spokeswoman Sara Bustilloz said.
Police and EMS were called to Bill’s Bottle Shop, located at Midland Drive and Neely Avenue, at about 8 p.m. by employees who said “a man was walking in and out of the store acting suspiciously,” Bustilloz said.
“At one point, they believed he stole from the store and then he came in bloody and was acting suicidal,” she said.
 She said the man — whose identity had not been released as of late Saturday night — was acting aggressively.
“Both officers used verbal commands before the subject charged officers with a box cutter,” Bustilloz said. “It’s believed at this time that both officers shot.”
She said that while the man cut himself, “it most  likely wasn’t enough to be fatal. Autopsy would show cause for sure, but he died shortly after the shooting.”
The man was transported to Midland Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, she said.
The officers will be placed on administrative leave pending an internal review, Bustilloz said.
“The Texas Rangers are also investigating, per normal protocol,” she said.
In the train incident, police responded at about 8:30 p.m. to a report of a pedestrian being hit by train. The man died at the scene, which was at the Terrell Street crossing, Bustillos said.
Crossings from Marienfeld Street to Lamesa Road were closed afterward, she said.
Foul play was not suspected, she said, but his identity wasn’t released Saturday night pending notification of next of kin.

The man shot and killed on Saturday after allegedly charging at two Midland police officers with a box cutter has been identified as 42-year-old Midlander Joe Nevels, according to a press release from city spokeswoman Sara Bustilloz.
The incident began before 8 p.m. when Nevels had been entering and exiting Bill’s Bottle Store at the corner of Midland Drive and Neely Avenue. Employees believed that Nevels had stolen from the store, and he was bleeding from cuts and acting suicidal, according to the release.
When Midland Police and Fire departments arrived at the scene about 8 p.m. Nevels was acting aggressively and charged a police officer with a box cutter, and both officers fired rounds at Nevels, according to the release.
While Nevels cut himself, “It most likely wasn’t enough to be fatal. Autopsy would show cause for sure, but he died shortly after the shooting,” Bustilloz said in a previous Reporter-Telegram article.
The officers -- whose identities have not been released pending an internal investigation -- have been put on administrative leave, as is protocol, according to the release. The Texas Rangers with the Department of Public Safety are investigating the use of force, according to the release.

ATLANTA - Atlanta police say one of their officers hit a man Friday night in southwest Atlanta.

The incident happened shortly after 9:30 p.m. on Metropolitan Parkway near Fair Street.

Authorities identified as 62-year-old Bernard Moore.

Investigators say Moore was taken to Grady Memorial where he later died.

A witness said he saw the police officer in his vehicle “came down the street flying and that’s when ‘bam.’”

“Ridiculous. For real, ridiculous. I’ve never seen nothing like that a day in my life,” said another witness.

Investigators said the officer was not responding to a call or using lights and sirens.

Channel 2's Steve Gehlbach said police told him Moore was more than 100 feet from the closest intersection.

“The individual was not in a crosswalk and the officer was just on routine patrol,” said Atlanta police deputy chief Darryl Tolleson.

Keshanna Spencer, holding her child in her arms, discusses why her family chose to sue the city over her father's death.
Keshanna Spencer's two-hour drive from Moody, Ala., to Atlanta used to be filled with excitement. For years, she would regularly travel from her home to visit her 62-year-old father Bernard Moore. That feeling of anticipation has given way to anguish following Moore's death at the hands of Atlanta Police.

""This will be my first Father's Day without him,"" says Spencer, who was holding her baby boy, Noah, as she fought back tears inside the Davis Bozeman Law Firm this morning. ""It's just really difficult. Every time I get on I-20 and head to Atlanta...to go there, and not be able to see him, is just really hard.""

More than two months after an APD patrol car fatally struck Moore, his family today filed a civil lawsuit against the city. Spencer, one of Moore's two children and the administrator of his estate, is asking for $5 million in damages stemming from her father’s wrongful death.

Around 9:30 p.m. on March 6, Moore started to cross Metropolitan Parkway near Fair Drive, less than three miles from his home in Peoplestown. APD Officer Christopher Blaise, who was allegedly speeding northbound on the four-lane road without his sirens on or lights flashing, struck Moore with his patrol car. Moore later died at Grady Memorial Hospital from injuries sustained in the accident.

According to the lawsuit, Blaise was negligently speeding, driving too fast for conditions, and recklessly driving, among other offenses. Robert Bozeman, an attorney representing Moore's family, today said Blaise was likely ""traveling almost twice the legal speed limit” of 35 miles per hour based on obtained surveillance footage and an accident reconstruction expert's findings.

APD Chief George Turner has not met with the Moore family despite their requests. At the Atlanta City Council Public Safety Committee meeting two weeks ago, civil rights attorney Mawuli ""Mel"" Davis says, several councilmembers were “very sincere in their condolences” expressed to Moore's son, Bernardo Hicks. Two APD officers also privately extended their condolences to Hicks after he spoke about his father's death.

Hicks says the APD police report contradicts the series of events captured on video surveillance. According to the police report, Moore ""rolled onto the hood smashing the windshield"" following the initial impact. Soon after, Blaise came to a ""controlled stop"" where Moore fell to the sidewalk, the report says. However, Hicks says, the video footage shows Moore ""flying through the air.""

""It’s very confusing,"" he says. ""When you view the tape, when you view the evidence, it's very clear. It makes no sense that you have to apply pressure to get justice. Justice should be automatic. But, as we can see, it’s not automatic. You have to fight for justice.""

The family's questions about their father's death remain unanswered. They hope a lawsuit will shine a light on the details surrounding his killing, explain why Blaise remains on active duty with APD, or force a public apology for his death.

""This isn’t just an ordinary car accident,"" Davis says. ""There’s something more to this because police are involved. Police, who were driving without lights, without sirens, and killed a citizen of the city Atlanta, should be held to a higher standard. We have not seen that adherence to a higher standard happen yet.""

According to Davis, the fact that Blaise has not been ""arrested, charged, ticketed, or indicted"" has forced the public to question the police department's actions. He says the frustration over the way police are treated differently than the citizens they serve has fueled tensions surrounding police-involved deaths in Baltimore; Cleveland; and Ferguson, Mo.

Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard says the case of an APD officer being accused of hitting and killing a man with his police car remains “open and active.” It was on the night of March 6, 2015, that 62 year old Bernard Moore was struck and killed while crossing Metropolitan Avenue. Mawuli Davis, an attorney for the Moore family says, “it took two weeks to bring charges in the Freddie Gray case” in Baltimore, “but it’s been two months since the death of 62 year old Bernard Moore in Atlanta and there hasn’t been an indictment.”

Below is D-A Howard’s statement:

“Within the past two years, the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office has indicted two police officers for vehicular homicide. One of those cases resulted in a conviction (State vs. Donald Crozier) and the other is scheduled for trial in September of this year (State vs. Joshua Sieck). A third officer-involved vehicular homicide case is currently being prepared for presentation to the Grand Jury.

According to our protocol, prior to a case being forwarded to our office for prosecutorial consideration, a preliminary investigation must first be conducted by the forwarding law-enforcement agency. Those findings are then turned over to our office for an independent investigation by our team of investigators. Once all of the evidence is gathered and evaluated, we then make a determination regarding an appropriate charging decision, if any.

On Tuesday, May 5, 2015, the Atlanta Police Department released its file involving Officer Blaise to our Public Integrity Unit. Although we have just received the file, our office has been in constant communication with all parties involved since the night of the incident. We responded to the scene immediately, we have reviewed the surveillance video on which the incident is captured, and we have met with the victim’s family. Our investigation is open and active.
Although we are well aware of the two months that have passed since this incident occurred, our decision to seek or not seek an indictment will be guided by the evidence and the law. As always, we shall attempt to complete our work in a timely manner.”

ATLANTA – After seven, long months, a Fulton County grand jury has indicted an Atlanta Police officer for the death of a pedestrian.
Officer Christopher Blaise faces misdemeanor charges of vehicular homicide and speeding. On March 6, 2015, Bernard Moore, 62, was struck down on Metropolitan Avenue in Atlanta. Witnesses said that the officer was speeding and that he did not have the car’s blue lights flashing. Seven months later, a Fulton County Grand jury has determined that Blaise should face criminal charges in the case.
Procedure calls for the case to be heard by a state court judge with the maximum sentence of 12 months for each charge.
Family attorney Mawuli Davis believes it was the recovery of the video tape from that evening “that helped lead to the misdemeanor charges.” According to Davis, “this officer will be held accountable. He will not just be able to walk freely without having to address these charges.”",Yes,No,,Yes,https://ioneadwnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bernard-moore2.jpg?w=214&h=236,NONE,9:30 PM,Outdoors,Street/Road,,Other,Cop was speeding and ran over victim,None of the above,,None of the above,,No,Yes,No,No,None of the above,,None of the above,,Other.

Tyrone Harris’ life ended Monday morning on a crowded Bon Air road, moments after he aimed a rifle out the window of a stolen car and fired at officers, police and witnesses said. Five officers returned fire, striking Harris and killing him.

It marked the end of a chaotic 30-minute period in which officers said Harris, 20, began opening fire about two blocks away from his previous home in Knoxville, stole a car from a man on Rochelle Street, and fired at a sheriff’s sergeant, prompting a chase through busy city streets.

Anthony Miess, 33, of McKees Rocks watched from behind a car while Harris exchanged gunfire with a group of officers from Pittsburgh and the Port Authority police departments.

“The dude continued to shoot for a while,” Mr. Miess said. “You ever see them gangster movies where a dude goes out hard? Yeah, he went out hard. He fell and he was down for good.

“The cops started putting their guns away, started patting each other on the back.”

Pittsburgh police Chief Cameron McLay said Monday evening he “can't say enough about the courage and the skill shown by the officers responding to this,” noting that no bystanders were injured at the final shooting scene.

But he also said, “Any time there’s a loss of human life, it’s a tragedy. ... Our hearts go out to all of those who have been adversely impacted in the community and those who are close to our actor.”

The motive, police said, remained a mystery Monday night.



Harris, who had recently bailed out of jail on a drug case, began firing with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle near the intersection of Knox Avenue and Orchard Place shortly after 10 a.m., police said.

His cousin, who works at the nearby Hilltop Community Children’s Center, had passed through the area only moments before, as she escorted a group of students to a spray park within walking distance. They heard the gunfire. She told the children it was firecrackers, executive director Marcia Walters said.

About 12 minutes later, police received a report of shooting on nearby Rentz Way. One man was struck in the shoulder and later released from a hospital, police said.

While some officers were en route to the shooting scene, they passed by Rochelle Street and were flagged down by a man who told them his white Buick LeSabre had been stolen. That man declined to comment, saying people already feared for their safety in Knoxville.

Officers described the man’s car on the police radio and two minutes later Allegheny County sheriff’s Sgt. Kevin Faulds, who two years ago detained three men in a Downtown shooting, spotted the stolen car near the intersection of Knox Avenue and Brownsville Road.

He tried to turn around to get behind the car, and Harris opened fire, narrowly missing the sergeant’s head and sending a bullet through his headrest, officials said. Other bullets hit his car.

Sgt. Faulds called out that he was under fire and “bravely continue[d] to follow the actor’s vehicle” as it drove along Brownsville Road onto Saw Mill Run Boulevard, Chief McLay said.

Another sheriff’s deputy, who had turned on his lights, collided with a car while trying to make it to the scene. That deputy and a woman in the other car were taken to UPMC Mercy and released later Monday, Sheriff William P. Mullen said.

About three minutes after Sgt. Faulds spotted the car, at 10:29 a.m., Harris got stuck in traffic on the crowded boulevard. That’s when the gun battle with officers resumed. At 10:31 and 51 seconds, officers noted in their records that “the situation was brought under control,” the chief said.

They called medics to the scene. Harris was pronounced dead five minutes later.

Some of his relatives, including the instructor at the the Hilltop Community Children’s Center, went to the shooting scene, Ms. Walters said. Later in the day, some family and friends gathered near his previous home address and the site of the original shooting scene. They declined to comment.

The officers who fired shots — four from the Pittsburgh police department and one from the Port Authority — have been placed on leave, per normal protocol for fatal shootings. Chief McLay said Monday he would not yet release the names of the officers but intended to do so at a later date.

“These individuals have families they need to notify,” he said.

It was unclear which of the officers struck Harris or where. An autopsy is scheduled for today.

“This almost represents the worst kind of day for an officer to have to face, in many ways,” Chief McLay said. “This kind of protracted running gun battle, when every other sane person on the planet is moving away from it, police officers are moving toward the sound of gunfire.”

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) – A rifle-wielding man was killed by police after a carjacking, shooting spree and exchanging gunfire with officers along busy Route 51 Monday morning.

According to police, the incident began on Jucunda Street shortly after 10 a.m. Police initially responded to the scene for a call of shots being fired.

The ordeal only lasted about 20 minutes, ending by 10:30 a.m., but police described it as 20 minutes of “terror.”

“A sheriff’s unit engaged that suspect inside the carjacked vehicle and the suspect began firing on that sheriff’s unit. A vehicle pursuit ensued and on Route 51, the sheriff’s unit was involved in a traffic collision with a civilian vehicle. One female was injured in that traffic collision. A few moments later, the incident came to an end near the intersection of Saw Mill Run and Bausman Street, where the suspect began shooting at our officers and they were forced to protect themselves and return fire,” Pittsburgh Police Lt. Edward Cunningham said.

In returning fire, police killed the suspect 20-year-old Tyrone Harris.

He had just been released from the Allegheny County Jail.

Police say there were four different shooting scenes and over 100 shots were fired.

Both of the injured women were taken to local hospitals for treatment and are expected to survive their injuries.

KDKA’s Marty Griffin Reports:


Police say Harris was a gang member from Beltzhoover who had some kind of breakdown and shot at his mother, then shot at a daycare, then a jitney driver, and finally, a sheriff’s deputy before being killed by police about 20 minutes into the ordeal.

In a press conference Monday evening, Pittsburgh Police Chief Cameron McLay said police received numerous 911 calls when it started, saying someone was shooting at civilians.

McLay said the carjacking victim, whose car was stolen by Harris on Rochelle Street, flagged down officers and described his vehicle to them, which is how they found Harris.

After a responding officer found Harris in the vehicle on Brownsville Road in Knoxville, McLay said Harris fired shots at the officer in his car.

Police then followed Harris onto Route 51, where he got stuck in traffic near the Liberty Tunnels and then started firing at officers. That’s when police – four city officers, and one from the Port Authority – opened fire on Harris and he was killed.

“The police officers were able to safely neutralize the situation, and no innocent parties were harmed, despite the dense traffic in the area,” said McLay.

The five officers, as is normal in any officer-involved shooting, are now on paid leave, while the investigation continues.

Police said Harris was armed with a semi-automatic rifle, similar to the kind used by officers.

“This almost represents the worst kind of day for an officer to have to face in many ways,” said McLay. “This type of situation highlights the fact that there are certain realities in our society today where officers have to be prepared to be highly-skilled to deal with incredibly dangerous circumstances.”

In the press conference, McLay thanked officers for their “professionalism” and ability to shield civilians from the gunfire, as the road was packed with traffic.

Police say Harris’ motive is still unclear.

The Allegheny County District Attorney’s office will be investigating.

 Police Respond to Davis and Wilbur

Police and other emergency responders secure the scene at an incident near the intersection of Wilbur Street and Davis Road Tuesday morning, September 8, 2015.
FAIRBANKS - A 19-year-old Galena man died on Wednesday of injuries sustained a week earlier in a police shooting in South Fairbanks.

Tristan Vent succumbed to his injuries at Alaska Native Native Medical Center in Anchorage. He was critically injured during a confrontation with police on Sept. 8 in a ball field near the intersection of Davis Road and Wilbur Street.

Fairbanks Police reportedly had stopped Vent in a vehicle that had been reported stolen. He refused to cooperate with officers and had a weapon in the vehicle, resulting in a standoff at the location that included police and Alaska State Troopers.

After attempts to negotiate failed, bean-bag rounds were reportedly fired at Vent without success. Troopers say the situation escalated rapidly, leading to five members of the troopers' D Detachment in Fairbanks firing their service weapons at him.

Those who fired at Vent included: Capt. Ronald Wall, a 25-year veteran; Trooper Jacob Hayungs, a one-year veteran; Trooper Edward Halbert, a 13-year veteran; Trooper Edwin Carlson, a nine-year veteran, and Trooper Recruit Tyler Langford, a seven-month veteran

The Alaska Bureau of Investigation in continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the shooting, according to a troopers news release.

The incident was one of two fatal police shootings in the Fairbanks area last week. A day after Vent was shot, a high-speed chase ended with a shootout between the occupants of the car and law enforcement officials. The vehicle's driver, 33-year-old Vincent J. Perdue of Fairbanks, was killed during the incident.

Galena man, Tristan Vent, died from wounds he sustained in last Tuesday’s Fairbanks shooting incident.
The man, 19-year-old Tristan Vent, who was involved in an officer-involved shooting in Fairbanks last Tuesday, has succumbed to his injuries sustained during that incident, trooper dispatch revealed this morning.

The 19-year-old Galena man was the subject of an attempted traffic stop at approximately 9:30 am on September 9th, after troopers observed that he was driving a vehicle that had been reported stolen earlier that morning.

When stopped, troopers reported that Vent was armed and additional troopers and Fairbanks police responded to the scene.

Initially, during the stand-off, negotiations were begun, and less than lethal force was employed, but the bean bags were ineffectual.

A short time later, gunfire erupted and Vent was seriously wounded. at Least five officers were reported to have been involved in the shooting.

Vent was taken to the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital for treatment and ultimately taken to the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage. Troopers were notified at 6:30 am, that Vent had died at ANMC.
